PENCE	But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.	0
TRUMP	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	0
CLINTON	I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.	0
CLINTON	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0
CRUZ	In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary.	1
TRUMP	But I know you well enough.	0
TRUMP	Right.	0
TRUMP	But you would have all done the same thing again.	0
TRUMP	That was a whole different world.	0
TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy greatly.	0
	Obama ... gave almost a million dollars to the (Kenya) opposition campaign who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga.	1
BLITZER	She said no.	0
COOPER	This concludes the town hall meeting.	0
CLINTON	I hope that I will be able to earn their support.	0
	I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, I will not raise taxes on the middle class.	1
TRUMP	That is a rough thing.	0
TRUMP	But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania.	0
TRUMP	And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t.	0
TRUMP	We’re doing very well.	0
	According to Wikipedia, there are only five countries in the entire planet that are more unequal than the United States in the distribution of our wealth.	0

	Our graduation rate is the highest it's ever been.	0

	Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way.	0
SANDERS	And, it is not good enough.	0
CLINTON	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	0
CLINTON	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0
TRUMP	"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""	0
TRUMP	It was settled.	0
TRUMP	But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve.	0
TRUMP	And we’re leading in many of the battleground states all over the country.	0
KAINE	They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.	0
	If Rhode Island applied a 1-percent sales tax on all items exempt from sales tax, ''the state would receive an additional $89,376,857.''	0
PENCE	And we fully support that.	0
	It is a greater crime to have an untagged alligator than to host an open house party (for kids).	0
	The law has not established whether Rhode Island public employees have property rights to their pensions.	0
TRUMP	According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.	1
TRUMP	It's going to be a big difference.	0
	Gov. Chris Christie owes the state money for amenities like extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips.	1
TRUMP	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	0
MADDOW	In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.	0

CLINTON	And let's -- let's...	0
CLINTON	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	0
	The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history.	0
TRUMP	They really know what they’re doing.	0
	Says in Canada, the number of CT scan machines per 1,000 people is like one-tenth of what we have here in this country. Thats why people have to wait.	1
PENCE	Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.	0
TRUMP	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	0
KAINE	And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.	1
CLINTON	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	0
TRUMP	True.	0
TRUMP	Let me just explain.	0
TRUMP	We all know it.	0
TRUMP	I’m a very famous person, unfortunately.	0
PENCE	Right.	0

TRUMP	I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.	0
CLINTON	... Well, we set conditions on Iran.	0
	The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'	0
TRUMP	It's not Ted's fault.	0
TRUMP	A disaster.	0
QUESTION	But you stood by him.	0
	Americas gun-related homicide rate would be about the same as Belgiums if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S.	1
TRUMP	We’re going to come back so strong.	0
TRUMP	You watch.	0
CLINTON	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	0
CLINTON	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0
TRUMP	Let me tell you.	0
TRUMP	And that’s a shame.	0
RUBIO	It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.	0
CLINTON	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0
	Weve got to find 2 billion gallons (of water per day) between now and 2025.	0
TRUMP	But I'm all for NATO.	0
TRUMP	You haven't done it.	0
TRUMP	When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before — for all Americans.	0
TRUMP	They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.	0

TRUMP	That’s just two days.	0

RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we're moving.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE CHEERING)	0
TRUMP	The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0
CLINTON	You know, let me tell you why.	0
COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
HOLT	The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.	0
BLITZER	I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important.	0
	Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s.	0
TRUMP	It’s a beautiful — it’s a beautiful piece of art.	0
SANDERS	Your answer has been the same year after year.	0
KAINE	Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?	0
BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
	Obama says Clinton in 2002 suggested there was a connection between al-Qaida and the Iraqi government.	0
CLINTON	Well, let me say then...	0
AUDIENCE	Booo —	0
TRUMP	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	0

	The governor won this state with 49 percent. We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So youre not dealing with this 70-30, like they want to make it.	0
CLINTON	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	0
CLINTON	Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0
	If the space-shuttle program is terminated, Russia and China will be the only nations ...with the capability to launch humans into space.	0
	Americanschools are more segregated than they were in the 1960s.	0
TRUMP	And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.	0
TRUMP	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	0
TRUMP	I know many of them.	0
KASICH	And I'm standing on this stage.	0
BLITZER	Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.	0
TRUMP	And the wall.	0
CLINTON	We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.	0

QUIJANO	I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.	0
TRUMP	Essentially.	0
	Says if you are on your bike in a crosswalk, all you have to do is dip your wheel into the road and cars must legally stop.	0
TRUMP	He was calling countries and his counterparts.	0
CLINTON	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	0
	We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery.	0
	Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California.	0
CLINTON	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
	On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make.	0

BLITZER	I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.	0
CLINTON	And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.	0
TRUMP	She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
TRUMP	I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions.	0

TRUMP	There's no quote.	1

TRUMP	Wait, wait, wait.	0
CARSON	But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.	0
TRUMP	But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn’t matter.	0
TRUMP	I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.	0
CLINTON	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.	0
	By the end of this budget Im in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state.	0
TRUMP	I’m sorry.	0
SANDERS	That is not the issue.	0
BLITZER	We're going to take a quick break.	0
CLINTON	And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.	0
TRUMP	All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal.	0
TRUMP	And then you wonder why I’m winning in Michigan.	0
TRUMP	But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.	0
CLINTON	Well, that's your opinion.	0

TRUMP	So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.	0
	A Texas police department bought an ad telling drug dealers, We can take your competition off the streets for FREE.	0
TRUMP	Go ahead, what would you like to say?	0
CLINTON	So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.	0
TRUMP	I have.	0
	Say Bernie Sanders won Nevada after all.	1
HOLT	Folks, we're going to...	0
TRUMP	I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...	0

CLINTON	go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.	0
TRUMP	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	0

RUBIO	Wolf, no.	0

PENCE	Elaine, I have to respond to this.	0

TRUMP	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	0
CARSON	They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.	0
CLINTON	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	0

TRUMP	Yeah, for 30 years.	0
CARSON	I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.	0
TRUMP	ISIS.	0
CARSON	Now...	0

TRUMP	And I figured, you know — I’m pretty good at construction — I figured, I don’t know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half.	0
TRUMP	And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.	0

TRUMP	In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers.	0

KAINE	He's not a leader.	0
CRUZ	During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?	0

TRUMP	She was a very successful person.	0

CLINTON	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0
BLITZER	We have to take a quick commercial break.	0

	The United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee paid time off to care for a new child.	0
	During the recession, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent.	0
CRUZ	... you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who -- who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.	0
	During the Bush administration, you actually had a prominent liberal write a book about how Bush was preparing for a fascist takeover of this country.	0

TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.	0
	Health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget.	0
CLINTON	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	0
TRUMP	But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month — the bad ones.	0

	No one beta-tested healthcare.gov.	0
CLINTON	And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me -- the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys -- is because I've got their number on all of that.	1
KASICH	Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.	0
TRUMP	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	0
CRUZ	Am I allowed to...	0
SANDERS	I am running for president as a Democrat.	0

TRUMP	We are going to take those people...	0
CLINTON	And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.	0
TRUMP	I’m going to lower your taxes so substantially.	0
PENCE	And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0

CLINTON	OK, Donald.	0
TRUMP	You know I always say we get the drugs, they get the cash.	0
TRUMP	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.	0
SANDERS	So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.	0
TRUMP	"Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?"	0
TRUMP	So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship — the Russian ship, as an example — I’m not going to tell you.	0
CLINTON	I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.	0
	Says Florida had five sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor.	1
CLINTON	And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.	0
BLITZER	Thank you.	0
TRUMP	So here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it.	0
SANDERS	The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.	0
CLINTON	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	0

BASH	Thank you.	0
	The congressional district for Miami-Dade and Broward counties has a staggering drop-out rate of almost 61 percent.	1

TODD	First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight.	0
	The Obama administration originally wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort.	0
TRUMP	We'll work on that.	0
KAINE	Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.	0
TRUMP	You have to see what’s outside, you wouldn’t even believe it.	0
TRUMP	We have to unify.	0
CLINTON	I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.	0
TRUMP	In fact, I’m very excited to announce tonight that we just received a few minutes ago the endorsement of the largest police union in the country, the Fraternal Order of Police.	0

	As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000 in a shady land deal from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution.	1

TRUMP	OK?	0
WALLACE	My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.	1
BLITZER	You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0

TRUMP	I’ve had great support from Congress generally.	0

TRUMP	I dream of running against those people.	0
QUESTION	In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.	0
KAINE	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.	0
	Says Donald Trump has bankrupt four separate businesses.	0
CLINTON	If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior.	0
CLINTON	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	0
WALLACE	I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...	0
TRUMP	Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that’s okay with me.	0
RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, you're first.	0
	The downsizing of Pinellas County government resulted in about 1,200 people being laid off in a 12 percent unemployment market. I can tell you that every one of them was hired from the time that Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000.	1

CLINTON	... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.	0
TRUMP	Politicians will never, ever get it done.	0
WALLACE	Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.	0
TRUMP	And maybe it's hardly doable.	0
HOLT	The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.	0
TRUMP	That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change.	0
TRUMP	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.	0

TRUMP	I wish it could have gone quicker.	0
BLITZER	One at a time, Mr. Trump.	0

TRUMP	I really haven't.	0
KASICH	I think it's practical.	0
SANDERS	Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.	1
TRUMP	They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.	0
TRUMP	Take a look at upstate New York.	0
CLINTON	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	0

TRUMP	But let me give you the bad news.	0

SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0

TRUMP	We’re going to get a good price, believe me.	0
CLINTON	And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.	0

TRUMP	I mean, cash.	0
	A record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border.	0
RUBIO	And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.	0
	For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built.	0
KAINE	We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.	0
	Wayne Powell has a stated position of having no objection to taking `In God We Trust off of U.S. currency.	0

TRUMP	But above all, we are together and we are Americans.	0
CLINTON	It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.	0

CLINTON	which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	0
BLITZER	I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue.	0
CLINTON	We faced 9/11.	0

CRUZ	Donald.	0
TRUMP	... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist.	0
KAINE	You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.	0

TRUMP	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0

	Says Obama replaced the American flag on the tail of his plane with his campaign logo.	0
	Says that all those who do not answer directly to the president, theyve said (repealing Dont Ask, Dont Tell) is a terrible idea.	1
RUBIO	And I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis.	0
TRUMP	Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.	0

SANDERS	That is exactly what we should be doing.	0
TRUMP	Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly.	0
CLINTON	And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.	0
PENCE	I have to go back to.	0
SANDERS	So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.	0
CLINTON	... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.	0
	By allowing brewpubs to sell beer, Georgia could become like Mexico with only a couple of manufacturers controlling all aspects of market.	1
KAINE	But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said.	0

	Says Rick Scott cut education by $1.3 billion in his first year, then in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities.	0
TRUMP	We’re doing Obamacare — we’re in final stages.	0
TRUMP	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
KASICH	That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.	0
CLINTON	I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.	0
SANDERS	"But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans."""	0
	Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.	1
PENCE	Oh...	0

PENCE	And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.	0
CLINTON	OK.	0
TRUMP	General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.	0
	Up to half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition.	0
CLINTON	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	0
TRUMP	But we are — we’re going to get it back.	0
QUIJANO	Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?	0
CLINTON	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	0
TRUMP	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	0
	It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Humayun Khans) life.	1
CLINTON	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.	0
	Says Ron Johnson voted to turn Medicare into a voucher program.	0
SANDERS	As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.	0

CRUZ	He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.	0
	The decision to cancel the trademark of the Washington Redskins is not the Patent and Trademark Office. This is Barack Obama.	1
CLINTON	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	0

CARSON	We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.	0

	Says wrestling was a favorite sport of Abraham Lincoln.	0
SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
TRUMP	First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.	0

RUBIO	But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams.	0

TRUMP	We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world.	0
	Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States. They are working fewer hours for more pay, living longer on average, and facing less income inequality.	0

KAINE	They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.	0
CLINTON	But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.	0
	Rep. Paul Ryans budget proposal cuts nothing from Medicare, Social Security or defense in the next two to three years, and in three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.	0
	Proposed cuts in the House farm bill mean 2 million less people on food stamps, 210,000 children will not receive school lunches or breakfasts.	0
TRUMP	Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz —- good lawyer — just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
KAINE	So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.	0
TRUMP	They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.	0
TRUMP	It’s a disaster.	0
CLINTON	People have been analyzing the new plan.	0
TRUMP	And in a way, I should be complaining.	0

PENCE	And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.	0
KAINE	Why did he say that?	0

TODD	Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.	0
HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
SANDERS	So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors.	0
TRUMP	But the ones that I find — I mean, I have men that don’t like it, but I have women that are incensed at what’s going on.	0
TRUMP	And hopefully — and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help.	0
RUBIO	Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.	0

CLINTON	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	0
BLITZER	Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?	0
SANDERS	... let us talk about issues.	0

RUBIO	But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.	0

SANDERS	But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.	0
TRUMP	Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.	0

	Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts.	1
PENCE	And that nation was secured in 2009.	0
KAINE	And we did something we had really wanted to do.	0

COOPER	We brought up the e-mails.	0
	Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media.	0
PENCE	And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...	0
QUIJANO	Does that seem fair to you?	0
	Says Scott Walkers views on abortion are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times.	0
SANDERS	And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.	0
TRUMP	I’m just telling you, you’re dishonest people.	0
RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.	0

CARSON	That's why we have divided government.	0
TRUMP	Where’s Aaron?	0
TRUMP	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0
TRUMP	But here’s the thing:  They have rampant inflation.	0
TRUMP	How do they do it?	0
TRUMP	We’re punishing them for bringing the money back in.	0
TRUMP	No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.	0
TRUMP	The president’s one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the Castro regime.	0
TRUMP	That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold.	0
TRUMP	I don’t blame you.	0
	Says the number-one source of illegal immigration is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again.	1
	There is already a mosque four blocks away.	0
CLINTON	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	0
CLINTON	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	0
TRUMP	And I am going to try — I will do everything within my power to fix that.	0
TRUMP	After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?	0

CLINTON	Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.	0
	Barack Hussein Obama will force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies.	1

QUESTION	Right.	0
TRUMP	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	0
CLINTON	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0
TRUMP	It’s really a fantastic thing to see.	0
	Says Ann Kirkpatrick votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time.	0

WALLACE	You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.	0

TRUMP	Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.	0
KASICH	The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces.	0
TRUMP	But they were not ignored by me, and they’re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
CLINTON	And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.	0
MADDOW	And with that, let's get going.	0
TRUMP	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	0
TRUMP	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.	0
TRUMP	Thank you all for being here.	0

CLINTON	I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.	0
TRUMP	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.	0
TRUMP	but we believed that we could make the country better.	0
KAINE	And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.	0
TRUMP	I have 145 judges.	0
TRUMP	Recently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror.	0
CLINTON	So I don't know -- I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.	0
TRUMP	People had a good time with me.	0
	Lets start with the premise that Rhode Island already has one of the 10 strictest [gun laws] amongst all the states.	0
SANDERS	It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0

TRUMP	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	0

KAINE	And she's got a plan to do it.	0
TRUMP	We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.	1

TRUMP	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
TRUMP	And we have defeated ISIS, essentially, a very short while ago, in the Middle East.	0
BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.	0
CLINTON	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	0

CLINTON	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0

TRUMP	Unemployment is at a 16-year low.	1
CLINTON	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	0
TRUMP	And if we can’t renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, we’re going to terminate the deal and we’ll start all over again, folks.	0
TRUMP	They would have won an appeal.	0
CLINTON	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	0
	McDonalds hamburgers are only 15 percent real beef. The other 85 percent is meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer.	1

TRUMP	And it’s open.	0

TRUMP	So don't tell me about words.	0
TRUMP	Yeah, I did.	0
TRUMP	Fake, fake news.	0
TRUMP	We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.	0
SANDERS	I will not politicize it.	0
TRUMP	But other people don't.	0

TRUMP	And it talked about — you saw it, front page.	0
TRUMP	We have states that are doing great.	0
	Its actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state.	0
CLINTON	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	0

RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?	0
QUESTION	Bush, 426 when he won as President.	0
	Under Obamas plan (for welfare), you wouldnt have to work and wouldnt have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.	1
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
CLINTON	I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead.	0
SANDERS	You know, so this is not -- this is not the biggest deal in the world.	0
CLINTON	We know how to get control of the debt.	0
	Currently, the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.	0
TRUMP	It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.	0
	A Republican bill that would change John Doe criminal investigations is creating exceptions in the law for politicians.	0
TRUMP	Their voice has been taken away.	0

CLINTON	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	0
RADDATZ	Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
TRUMP	She didn’t do anything.	0
TRUMP	Not anymore.	0
PENCE	So you bet I suspended that program.	0
	Florida is the largest dog-racing state in the country.	0
CLINTON	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	0
	Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion.	0
TRUMP	I love you too.	0
TRUMP	If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.	0
	Says some Wisconsin state employee contracts gave some employees $4 for bringing in their own lunch.	0

SANDERS	And suddenly...	0
RUBIO	I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president.	0
TRUMP	Nothing changes.	0
TRUMP	I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.	0
TRUMP	Let's defeat her in November, okay?	0
SANDERS	Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?	0
TRUMP	If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.	0
TRUMP	I saw his statement.	0
	Barack Hussein Obama will ... force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks.	1
	Mental health provisions related to mass shootings got over 90 votes in the Senate.	0
TRUMP	Remember this — if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.	0
CLINTON	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.	0
TRUMP	"I heard somebody on a certain network last night — I won’t mention which one — say, ""Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?"""	0
CLINTON	They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.	0
TRUMP	This is a great land.	0

TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
RUBIO	I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...	0
TRUMP	I think he’s friend.	0
	This is the first time since the Depression that unemployment has stayed above 9 percent for two consecutive years.	1
BASH	And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.	0
TRUMP	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	0
TRUMP	ICE just endorsed me.	0

TRUMP	They're going to expand their companies.	0
PENCE	Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.	0
TRUMP	And she was forced to apologize.	0
	Says a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years.	1
TRUMP	That’s not going to happen while I’m President.	0
	The Iranians continue in the view of every objective observer continue to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons.	1
	In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children.	0
SANDERS	That is what power is about.	0
TRUMP	It’s ridiculous.	0
SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
RUBIO	So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.	0
RUBIO	He's done it again.	0
TRUMP	I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race -- he has left Iowa and he's out of the race.	0
CLINTON	... but the fact is he did.	0
	An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result.	1
TRUMP	Guess what?	0
KASICH	This is what we are actually doing in our state.	0
	Says she was misquoted and didnt say that the Israeli ambassador said what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel.	1
TRUMP	I want to make America great again.	0
CLINTON	I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.	0
	If you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since (Bob McDonnell) became governor.	0
QUIJANO	Do we ask too much of police officers in this country?	0
	Children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt.	0
CLINTON	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	0
	Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year.	0
TRUMP	I think he’s a friend of mine.	0
TRUMP	And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines —	0
KAINE	Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.	0
TRUMP	Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.	0
TRUMP	And that's what's she's done.	0
TRUMP	OK?	0
TRUMP	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0
QUESTION	You have daughters.	0
TRUMP	And they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher.	0
TRUMP	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	0
TRUMP	At some point, I’ll, you know, give these letters — they’re incredible letters.	0
KASICH	... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...	0
TRUMP	The next day, I watched ABC news.	0
TRUMP	And most of you know exactly what I’m talking about.	0
	The typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota under Gov. Scott Walkers policies.	0
BLITZER	I want to talk about the economy.	0
SANDERS	Can I answer...	0
	Says the Ohio Consumers Council office employs 74 lawyers and that the funding them is wasteful duplication.	1
	Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country.	0
TRUMP	I’ll tell you what.	0
	We have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year.	0
	In my home state, nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty.	0
TRUMP	Is that okay?	0
TRUMP	They just announced yesterday they’re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico.	1
TRUMP	I think it's a disgrace.	0
SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).	0
	Weve seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21.	1
	Twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs.	0
TRUMP	Guess what happened?	0
	Oregonians have an amazing no-cost way to fight abortion with free political donations	0
TRUMP	We either have a border or we don't.	0
	Says a tweet he sent out wasnt saying, check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the background of Alicia Machado.	1
	Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.	0
BLITZER	I want to move -- I want to move on.	0
CLINTON	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	0
KAINE	As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.	0
TRUMP	And I think that's great.	0
	The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing.	0
CLINTON	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0
TRUMP	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.	0
TRUMP	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	0
QUESTION	Can I — can I just ask —	0
	More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history.	1
WALLACE	Why, sir?	0
	Says U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst does not support a national minimum wage.	0
TRUMP	No puppet.	0
TRUMP	Okay, sit down.	0
PENCE	We -- we grieve with those who grieve.	0
SANDERS	That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.	0
TRUMP	And we will use it to light up the world.	0
TRUMP	But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.	0
TRUMP	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	0
WALLACE	Sir, if I may finish my question...	0
CLINTON	And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.	0
TRUMP	It's a great thing for the middle class.	0
CLINTON	So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.	0
CLINTON	They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.	0
	Says Rick Scott thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control.	0
TRUMP	In fact, the markets have gone up.	0
TRUMP	So I could have you chosen for a position.	0

	Ann Kuster supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion.	1
	Says state Sen. Morgan Carrolls votes made it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first.	1
WALLACE	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?	0
TRUMP	Ended up becoming citizens.	0
TRUMP	And I think we have to have it.	0
CLINTON	We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.	0
	In a majority of states, you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love.	0
CLINTON	If you've got something to say, say it directly.	0
TRUMP	They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.	0
TRUMP	They’re great.	0
	Says getting ex-cons to successfully return to society is important so we are not always faced constantly with recidivism, which is a big problem in the penitentiary today in the 70 to 80 percent range.	1
TRUMP	Sky News.	0
TRUMP	It had a very, very big impact.	0
	Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in 2007.	0
TRUMP	Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.	0
TRUMP	Yes.	0
CLINTON	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	0
CLINTON	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	0
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
TRUMP	And he’s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it’s the Justice Department.	0
	Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler has never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall.	1
	Say Ohio Reps. Marcia Fudge, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich are socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress.	1
KASICH	No one could even believe it happened.	0
PENCE	There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.	0
	Says recall organizers started their website last November and began work on their effort before he even took office.	1
CLINTON	You've proposed an approach that has a...	0
WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.	0
CLINTON	So we've got to do something for them.	0
	Under Gov. Scott Walkers public-school budgets, a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in his or her education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school.	1
WALLACE	Secretary, thank you.	0
	In Wisconsin, 300,000 voters were turned away by the states strict voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election.	1
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
RUBIO	... His plan.	0
TRUMP	They want money.	0
TRUMP	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	0
	Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.	0
	In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication.	0
TRUMP	And we will stand with oppressed people.	0
	On choosing a Texas House speaker	1
QUESTION	(Laughs).	0
TRUMP	And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.	0
	If lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated.	1
TRUMP	— thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.	0
	The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal.	0
QUESTION	So my question is —	0
TRUMP	To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad.	0
CLINTON	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	0
	We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.	0
TRUMP	And those women — they’re incredible women — they went on television — and they didn’t want to, and I didn’t ask them.	0
KASICH	Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well.	0
TRUMP	The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
KAINE	But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.	0
BLITZER	We're here in Brooklyn.	0
SANDERS	Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.	0
	Rick Perry doesnt think there should be a federal minimum wage.	0
TRUMP	The time for trivial fights is behind us.	0
TRUMP	Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this.	0
BASH	So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare.	0
TRUMP	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0
	We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care.	0
SANDERS	Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.	0
CRUZ	And by the way...	0
	Americans invented the automobile.	1
	Signs letter saying Consumer Product Safety Commission is acting without consultation or input from the company to stop the sale of Buckyballs.	1
TRUMP	Could be that we don’t work it out.	0
TRUMP	And I got 46 percent.	0
TRUMP	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	0
	When we had a conservative Republican president we were losing 750,000 jobs a month.	0
	We are at a 40-year low in our crime rate in our state.	0
TRUMP	Right now they're making a fortune.	0
TRUMP	We expect our partners — whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific — to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.	0
TRUMP	It doesn’t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet.	0
TRUMP	When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately.	0
CLINTON	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0
KAINE	Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.	0
TRUMP	So -- so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly.	0
TRUMP	We will cut so much, your head will spin.	0
	On the main GOP presidential debate:Not one candidate on the debate stage has military experience	0
CLINTON	Let's do that again in America.	0
PENCE	We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.	0
WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.	0
PENCE	He's going...	0
	We gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union.	1
TRUMP	We will build a wall.	0
	SaysJosh Mandels campaign is under FBI investigation	1
KAINE	And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.	0
TRUMP	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	0
TRUMP	So it’s very important to me.	0
TRUMP	We lost — tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS.	0
CLINTON	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	0
CLINTON	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	0
KASICH	And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years.	0

TRUMP	Believe me.	0
SANDERS	I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...	0

TRUMP	But it's not $650.	0
CLINTON	Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts.	0

CLINTON	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	0

CLINTON	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	0
TRUMP	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	0
HEWITT	Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills.	0
TRUMP	And they are being slaughtered...	0
TRUMP	In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states.	1
CLINTON	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	0
TRUMP	These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.	1

SANDERS	I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	0
	$500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families.	0
CLINTON	Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.	0
TODD	90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.	0
CLINTON	I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.	0
COOPER	Thank you.	0
	We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina with the passage of HB2.	1
	In just a few decades, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, other mandatory spending programs, and paying interest due on the debt will eclipse our entire budget.	0
	In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence.	0

TRUMP	They had a rough weekend.	0
	There were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks.	1
TRUMP	And you know what?	0
HEWITT	Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?	0
TRUMP	That's the largest increase in 25 years.	1
	Six of Georgias counties have no lawyers at all.	0
TRUMP	We have decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.	0

TRUMP	And I’m sure we’ll make a very good deal.	0
CLINTON	They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.	0
SANDERS	When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.	0
TRUMP	Think about it.	0
KAINE	The Trump plan is a different plan.	0

	Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level.	0
TRUMP	And I said them a long time ago, and I was right.	0
MADDOW	So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats.	0
TRUMP	We should have -- wait one second.	0
	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.	0

TRUMP	It was as though — I mean, the biggest thing that’s ever happened.	0

SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
SANDERS	Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers.	0
CLINTON	President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.	0
TRUMP	Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.	0
CLINTON	If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.	0
TRUMP	You can't.	0
TRUMP	We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.	0
TRUMP	It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.	0
CLINTON	We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it.	0

TRUMP	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	0
TRUMP	These are a few that we’re naming.	0
	George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.	0
CLINTON	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	0
TRUMP	It’s a disaster.	0
TODD	I didn't say that...	0
	On expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.	1
CLINTON	And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.	0
	To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram.	0
	In the last 10 years we've only had 7,000 barrels of oil spilled in the Gulf ... not counting hurricanes. This well is spewing that amount every day and a half.	0

TRUMP	But I've hired people.	0
TRUMP	Not going to happen anymore.	0
	Because of the new health care law, 2.5 million young adults now have coverage.	0

COOPER	You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.	0
	Roadside bombs are responsible for 70 percent of casualties in Iraq and these new mine-resistant vehicles can reduce those casualties by two-thirds.	0
CLINTON	I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.	0
TRUMP	I think they're going to see through it.	0
SANDERS	For trying to get an education.	0
TRUMP	Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.	1

TRUMP	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	0
BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
CLINTON	But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.	0
TODD	And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.	0
BLITZER	Thank you.	0
RUBIO	And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.	0
TRUMP	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	0
CLINTON	And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.	0
TRUMP	As -- and believe me, I'll win that case.	0

TRUMP	These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates.	0

CLINTON	with the Russians and other foreign powers.	0

CARSON	The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?	0
TRUMP	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.	1

	Texas this fiscal year will have more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined.	1
TRUMP	We're going to make a great country again.	0
TRUMP	Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.	1
TRUMP	Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.	1
TRUMP	As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums.	1
TRUMP	I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.	1
TRUMP	I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.	1
TRUMP	That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare.	0
TRUMP	Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.	1
TRUMP	Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.	0
TRUMP	The Democrats' plan threatens America's seniors.	0
TRUMP	The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised.	0
TRUMP	By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.	1
TRUMP	Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business.	0
TRUMP	Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors.	0
TRUMP	There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures.	0
TRUMP	Previously covered care would effectively be denied.	0
TRUMP	In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None.	0
TRUMP	Under the Democrats' plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die.	0
TRUMP	The Democrats' plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own health care decisions.	0
TRUMP	Instead, Democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.	0
TRUMP	My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction.	0
TRUMP	The first thing the Democratic plan will do to end choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about 20 million seniors as well as eliminate other private health plans that seniors currently use to supplement their Medicare coverage.	0
TRUMP	Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American’s private and employer-based health plan.	0
TRUMP	It is right there in their proposed legislation: Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan.	0
TRUMP	Americans might think that such an extreme, anti-senior, anti-choice and anti-consumer proposal for government-run health care would find little support among Democrats in Congress.	0
TRUMP	Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation.	1
TRUMP	Democratic nominees for governor in Florida, California and Maryland are all campaigning in support of it, as are many Democratic congressional candidates.	0
TRUMP	Democrats want open-borders socialism.	1
TRUMP	The truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead.	0
TRUMP	The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America’s economy after Venezuela.	0
TRUMP	If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America.	0
TRUMP	Government-run health care is just the beginning.	0
TRUMP	Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the U.S. economy.	0
TRUMP	Every single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life.	0
TRUMP	Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay.	0
TRUMP	Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.	1
TRUMP	That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.	0
TRUMP	Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.	1
TRUMP	This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.	0
TRUMP	Under its vision, costs will spiral out of control.	0
TRUMP	Taxes will skyrocket.	0
TRUMP	And Democrats will seek to slash budgets for seniors’ Medicare, Social Security and defense.	0
TRUMP	Republicans believe that a Medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved.	0
TRUMP	I am committed to resolutely defending Medicare and Social Security from the radical socialist plans of the Democrats.	0
TRUMP	For the sake of our country, our prosperity, our seniors and all Americans — this is a fight we must win.	0
TRUMP	Okay, thank you very much.	0
TRUMP	It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.	0
TRUMP	And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.	0
TRUMP	Criminal justice reform — as you know, we've just heard word — got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote.	0
TRUMP	We have great Democrat support, great Republican support.	0
TRUMP	So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get — how long, Nancy?	0
TRUMP	Many years.	0
PELOSI	A long time.	0
TRUMP	Many, many years.	0
TRUMP	Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully — famous last words — on a very bipartisan way.	0
TRUMP	And it's really something we're all very proud of.	0
TRUMP	And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats.	0
TRUMP	And I think it's going to get a very good vote.	0
TRUMP	And we'll see soon enough.	0
TRUMP	But it will be up for a vote very shortly.	0
TRUMP	A lot of years they've been waiting for it.	0
TRUMP	The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely.	0
TRUMP	And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.	0
TRUMP	But pretty close.	0
SCHUMER	Soon.	0
SCHUMER	Soon.	0
SYSTEM	(Inaudible.)	0
TRUMP	And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.	0
TRUMP	A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of.	0
TRUMP	And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon.	0
TRUMP	And then we have the easy one, the wall.	0
TRUMP	That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.	0
TRUMP	What do you think, Chuck?	0
TRUMP	Maybe not?	0
SCHUMER	"It's called ""funding the government,"" Mr. President."	0
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
TRUMP	So we're going to see.	0
TRUMP	But I will tell you, the wall will get built.	0
TRUMP	We'll see what happens.	0
TRUMP	It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than — I can say — the Republicans.	0
TRUMP	We have great Republican support.	0
TRUMP	We don't have Democrat support.	0
TRUMP	But we're going to talk about that now.	0
TRUMP	We're going to see.	0
TRUMP	One thing that I do have to say is:	0
TRUMP	Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of — a lot of wall.	0
TRUMP	When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work.	0
TRUMP	In San Diego, we're building new walls right now.	0
TRUMP	And we've — right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well.	0
TRUMP	So, a lot of wall has been built.	0
TRUMP	We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building — it's being built right now, big sections of wall.	0
TRUMP	And we will continue that.	0
TRUMP	And one way or the other, it's going to get built.	0
TRUMP	I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.	0
TRUMP	We will see what happens over the next short period of time.	0
TRUMP	But the wall is a very important thing to us.	0
TRUMP	I might put it a different way.	0
TRUMP	Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security.	0
TRUMP	When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of — we shut it down; we had no choice.	0
TRUMP	We shut it down.	0
TRUMP	But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.	0
TRUMP	I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.	0
TRUMP	They've been incredible.	0
TRUMP	The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible.	0
TRUMP	And very importantly, our military.	0
TRUMP	Our military went in and they did an incredible job.	0
TRUMP	They have been really, really spectacular.	0
TRUMP	A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in — they were going to come in even in a rough way — many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries.	0
TRUMP	They're leaving.	0
TRUMP	If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico.	0
TRUMP	And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well.	0
TRUMP	So we appreciate that.	0
TRUMP	But they haven't been coming into our country.	0
TRUMP	We can't let people come in that way.	0
TRUMP	So that's pretty much it.	0
TRUMP	We're going to talk about the wall.	0
TRUMP	I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is.	0
TRUMP	I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is.	0
TRUMP	And I want to talk about the wall.	0
TRUMP	"And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of — I really think I can say ""border security,"" but certainly the wall."	0
TRUMP	But the wall will get built.	0
TRUMP	A lot of the wall is built.	1
TRUMP	It's been very effective.	1
TRUMP	I asked for a couple of notes on that.	0
TRUMP	If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.	1
TRUMP	El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.	1
TRUMP	In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.	1
TRUMP	Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.	1
TRUMP	"I mean — and when I say ""dropped,"" the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built."	0
TRUMP	It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.	1
TRUMP	So, I mean, it's very effective.	1
TRUMP	If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel — 99.9 percent effective.	0
TRUMP	And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.	0
TRUMP	So we've done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built.	0
TRUMP	A lot of people don't know that.	0
TRUMP	A lot of wall is renovated.	0
TRUMP	We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape.	0
TRUMP	And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military.	0
TRUMP	Our military has done a fantastic job.	0
TRUMP	So the wall will get built, but we may not — we may not have an agreement today.	0
TRUMP	We probably won't.	0
TRUMP	But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.	0
TRUMP	Nancy, would you like to say something?	0
PELOSI	Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people.	0
PELOSI	I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.	0
PELOSI	You have the White House —	0
TRUMP	"Did you say ""Trump"" — oh, oh."	0
PELOSI	"A ""Trump shutdown."""	0
PELOSI	You have the White House —	0
TRUMP	"I was going to call it a ""Pelosi shutdown."""	0
PELOSI	You have the Senate.	0
PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.	0
PELOSI	You have the votes.	0
PELOSI	You should pass it right now.	0
TRUMP	No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it.	0
PELOSI	No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today.	0
TRUMP	Yeah, but I can't — excuse me.	0
TRUMP	But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.	0
TRUMP	I don't want to waste time.	0
PELOSI	Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.	0
TRUMP	The House we can get passed very easily, and we do.	0
PELOSI	Okay, then do it.	0
PELOSI	Then do it.	0
TRUMP	But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote.	0
PELOSI	No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President.	0
PELOSI	The point is —	0
TRUMP	It's sort of the point.	0
PELOSI	— that there are equities to be weighed.	0
PELOSI	And we are here to have a conversation —	0
TRUMP	Correct.	0
PELOSI	— in a careful way.	0
PELOSI	So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.	0
PELOSI	But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want.	0
TRUMP	If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately.	0
TRUMP	We would get it passed very easily in the House.	0
PELOSI	No, that's not the point.	0
PELOSI	That's not the point.	0
TRUMP	Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.	0
TRUMP	It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.	0
TRUMP	That's the problem.	0
PELOSI	Well, again, let us have our conversation —	0
TRUMP	That's right.	0
PELOSI	— and then we can meet with the press again.	0
PELOSI	But the fact is, is that legislating — which is what we do —	0
TRUMP	Right.	0
PELOSI	— you begin, you make your point, you state your case.	0
PELOSI	That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes.	0
PELOSI	But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall — no matter where you start.	0
SCHUMER	That is exactly right.	0
SCHUMER	You don't have the votes in the House.	0
TRUMP	If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them — in one session, it would be done.	0
PELOSI	Well, then go do it.	0
PELOSI	Go do it.	0
TRUMP	It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.	0
PELOSI	No, don't put it on the Senate.	0
PELOSI	Put it on the negotiation.	0
TRUMP	Okay, let me ask you this.	0
TRUMP	Just — and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.	0
TRUMP	It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans —	0
PELOSI	You will not win.	0
TRUMP	It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.	0
PELOSI	Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President.	0
TRUMP	I need 10 senators.	0
TRUMP	That's the problem.	0
PELOSI	Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.	0
TRUMP	I have the White House.	0
PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.	0
TRUMP	The White House is done.	0
TRUMP	And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.	0
TRUMP	But I can't because I need —	0
PELOSI	But you can't — you can't —	0
TRUMP	Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.	0
SCHUMER	All right, let me say something here.	0
PELOSI	Mr. President, let me — let me just say one thing.	0
PELOSI	The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.	0
TRUMP	Nancy, I do.	0
TRUMP	And we need border security.	0
PELOSI	Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out.	0
TRUMP	Nancy.	0
TRUMP	Nancy.	0
TRUMP	We need border security.	0
TRUMP	It's very simple.	0
PELOSI	Of course we do.	0
TRUMP	We need border security.	0
PELOSI	We do.	0
TRUMP	People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.	1
TRUMP	We have terrorists.	0
TRUMP	We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.	1
TRUMP	Ten.	0
TRUMP	These are very serious people.	0
TRUMP	Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done.	0
TRUMP	But we caught 10 terrorists.	1
TRUMP	These are people that were looking to do harm.	0
TRUMP	We need the wall.	0
TRUMP	We need — more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece.	0
TRUMP	But it's important.	0
TRUMP	Chuck, did you want to say something?	0
SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
SCHUMER	Here's what I want to say:	0
SCHUMER	We have a lot of disagreements here.	0
SCHUMER	The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is — how much of the wall is built and how much is there.	0
SCHUMER	But that's not the point here.	0
SCHUMER	We have a disagreement about the wall —	0
TRUMP	Well, the Washington Post —	0
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
SCHUMER	— whether it's effective or it isn't.	0
SCHUMER	Not on border security, but on the wall.	0
SCHUMER	We do not want to shut down the government.	0
SCHUMER	You have called 20 times to shut down the government.	0
SCHUMER	"You say, ""I want to shut down the government."""	0
SCHUMER	We don't.	0
SCHUMER	We want to come to an agreement.	0
SCHUMER	If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government.	0
SCHUMER	And that's what we're urging you to do.	0
SCHUMER	Not threaten to shut down the government —	0
TRUMP	Chuck —	0
SCHUMER	— because you —	0
TRUMP	You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.	0
SCHUMER	Let me just finish.	0
SCHUMER	Because you can't get your way.	0
TRUMP	Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.	0
SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
SCHUMER	Let me say something, Mr. President.	0
SCHUMER	"You just say, ""My way, or we'll shut down the government."""	0
SCHUMER	We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.	0
SCHUMER	We urge you to take it.	0
TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.	0
PELOSI	It is good border security.	0
SCHUMER	It is very good border security.	0
TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.	0
PELOSI	It's actually what the border security asked for.	0
SCHUMER	It's what the border —	0
TRUMP	Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military —	0
SCHUMER	You just said it is effective.	0
TRUMP	Can I be — can I tell you something?	0
SCHUMER	Yeah, you just said it's effective.	0
TRUMP	Without a wall — these are only areas where you have the walls.	0
SCHUMER	We want to do this —	0
TRUMP	Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective.	0
TRUMP	Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.	0
PELOSI	Wait a second.	0
PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.	0
SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.	0
PELOSI	We've come in here as the first branch of government: Article I, the legislative branch.	0
PELOSI	We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.	0
SCHUMER	Open.	0
TRUMP	We're going to keep it open —	0
PELOSI	The American —	0
TRUMP	— if we have border security.	0
PELOSI	The American —	0
TRUMP	If we don't have border security, Chuck —	0
PELOSI	I'm with you.	0
TRUMP	— we're not going to keep it open.	0
PELOSI	I'm with you.	0
PELOSI	We are going to have border security.	0
SCHUMER	And it's the same border –	0
PELOSI	Effective border security.	0
SCHUMER	You're bragging about what has been done.	0
TRUMP	By us.	0
SCHUMER	We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.	0
SCHUMER	That's our proposal.	0
SCHUMER	If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.	0
TRUMP	Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.	0
SCHUMER	Let's debate —	0
PELOSI	We have taken —	0
SCHUMER	Let's debate in private.	0
PELOSI	We have taken this conversation —	0
SCHUMER	Okay?	0
TRUMP	Okay.	0
SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
PELOSI	— to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact.	0
PELOSI	And we can dispel that.	0
TRUMP	We need border security.	0
TRUMP	And I think we all agree that we need border security.	0
SCHUMER	Yes, we do.	0
TRUMP	Is that right?	0
SCHUMER	We do.	0
TRUMP	See?	0
TRUMP	We get along.	0
TRUMP	Thank you, everybody.	0
SYSTEM	(Inaudible)	0
QUESTION	Mr. President.	0
QUESTION	You say border security and the wall.	0
QUESTION	Can you have border security without the wall?	0
QUESTION	There's a commonality on border security.	0
TRUMP	No, you need the wall.	0
TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.	0
QUESTION	Are you re-defining what it means to have border security?	0
SCHUMER	Yes.	0
TRUMP	Yeah.	0
TRUMP	We need border security.	0
TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.	0
TRUMP	You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.	0
PELOSI	That's simply not true.	0
PELOSI	That is a political promise.	0
PELOSI	Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.	0
SCHUMER	And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.	0
TRUMP	It totally solves the problem.	0
PELOSI	Again, but I don't want to take this —	0
TRUMP	And it's very important.	0
PELOSI	"Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from — we came at a place to say, ""How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?"""	0
PELOSI	The economy has — people are losing their jobs.	1
PELOSI	The market is in a mood.	0
PELOSI	Our members are already (inaudible).	0
TRUMP	Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years.	1
PELOSI	Sixty people of the Republican Party have lost — are losing their offices now because of the transition.	0
PELOSI	People are not — the morale is not —	0
TRUMP	And we've gained in the Senate.	0
TRUMP	Nancy, we've gained in the Senate.	0
PELOSI	The morale —	0
TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
TRUMP	Did we win the Senate?	0
PELOSI	— is not (inaudible).	0
TRUMP	We won the Senate.	0
PELOSI	When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.	0
TRUMP	I did.	0
PELOSI	Let me say this.	0
TRUMP	We did win North Dakota.	0
PELOSI	This is the most unfortunate thing.	0
PELOSI	We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view.	0
TRUMP	But it's not bad, Nancy.	0
PELOSI	Let us — no, but it's —	0
TRUMP	It's called transparency.	0
PELOSI	I know.	0
PELOSI	But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.	0
PELOSI	And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  —	0
TRUMP	You know what?	0
TRUMP	We need border security.	0
PELOSI	"— without saying to the public, ""This isn't true."""	0
TRUMP	That's what we're going to be talking about: border security.	0
TRUMP	If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government.	0
TRUMP	This country needs border security.	0
PELOSI	We agree with that.	0
TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.	0
SYSYTEM	(Inaudible.)	0
TRUMP	Let's have a talk.	0
TRUMP	We're going to get the wall built and we've done a lot of wall already.	0
QUESTION	Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?	0
QUESTION	Is that the —	0
TRUMP	It's a big section.	0
TRUMP	It's a big part of it.	0
QUESTION	Is it everything that you need?	0
TRUMP	It's a big part of it.	0
TRUMP	We need to have effective border security.	0
TRUMP	We need a wall in certain parts — no, not in all parts — but in certain parts of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall.	0
QUESTION	How much money, Mr. President?	0
TRUMP	We are doing it much under budget.	0
TRUMP	We're actually way under —	0
QUESTION	(Inaudible) this conversation.	0
TRUMP	— budget on the areas that we've renovated and areas that we've built.	0
TRUMP	I would say if we got —	0
QUESTION	Do you still need the —	0
TRUMP	— if we got $5 billion, we could do a tremendous chunk of wall.	0
QUESTION	Is that mandatory?	0
QUESTION	Would you accept less though?	0
QUESTION	And are your guests conversely willing to offer more?	0
TRUMP	Well, we're going to see.	0
TRUMP	We're going to see.	0
TRUMP	Look, we have to have the wall.	0
TRUMP	This isn't a question; this is a national emergency.	0
TRUMP	Drugs are pouring into our country.	0
TRUMP	People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases, it's contagious.	1
TRUMP	They're pouring into our country.	0
TRUMP	We have to have border security.	0
TRUMP	We have to have a wall as part of border security.	0
TRUMP	And I don't think we really disagree so much.	0
TRUMP	I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that.	0
TRUMP	And I fully understand that.	0
TRUMP	We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.	0
PELOSI	Mr. President —	0
TRUMP	But we have to have border security.	0
PELOSI	Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the Leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory.	0
PELOSI	But let me —	0
SCHUMER	Elections have consequences, Mr. President.	0
PELOSI	Let me just say —	0
TRUMP	That's right.	0
TRUMP	And that's why the country is doing so well.	0
PELOSI	Let me say this:	0
PELOSI	What the President is representing in terms of his cards over there are not factual.	0
PELOSI	We have to have to an evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent, and how effective it is.	0
PELOSI	This isn't about — this is about the security of our country.	0
PELOSI	We take an oath to protect and defend, and we don't want to have that mischaracterized by anyone.	0
PELOSI	And we are —	0
TRUMP	I agree with that.	0
PELOSI	— that we are —	0
TRUMP	No, no I agree with that.	0
PELOSI	— we are (inaudible).	0
PELOSI	So let us have a conversation where we don't have to contradict, in public, the statistics that you put forth but instead can have a conversation about what would really work and what the American people deserve from us at this uncertain time in their lives, where they have apprehension.	0
SCHUMER	The one thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute.	0
SCHUMER	And you want to shut it down.	0
TRUMP	You keep talking about it.	0
TRUMP	I — no, no, no, no, no.	0
TRUMP	The last time, Chuck, you shut it down —	1
SCHUMER	No, no, no.	0
TRUMP	— and then you opened it up very quickly.	0
SCHUMER	Twenty times.	0
SCHUMER	Twenty times.	0
TRUMP	And I don't want to do what you did.	0
TRUMP	But, Chuck —	0
SCHUMER	"Twenty times you have called for, ""I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall."""	0
SCHUMER	None of us have said —	0
TRUMP	You want to know something?	0
SCHUMER	You've said it.	0
TRUMP	Okay, you want to put that on my —	0
SCHUMER	You said it.	0
TRUMP	I'll take it.	0
SCHUMER	Okay, good.	0
TRUMP	You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other — whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government.	0
TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
SCHUMER	Okay.	0
SCHUMER	Fair enough.	0
SCHUMER	We disagree.	0
TRUMP	And I am proud — and I'll tell you what —	0
SCHUMER	We disagree.	0
TRUMP	I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.	0
TRUMP	So I will take the mantle.	0
TRUMP	I will be the one to shut it down.	0
TRUMP	I'm not going to blame you for it.	0
TRUMP	The last time you shut it down, it didn't work.	0
TRUMP	I will take the mantle of shutting down.	0
PELOSI	That is (inaudible).	0
TRUMP	And I'm going to shut it down for border security.	0
SCHUMER	But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.	0
TRUMP	Okay.	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.	0
TRUMP	Thank you.	0
PELOSI	(Inaudible) shut down the government.	0
QUESTION	Chief of Staff?	0
QUESTION	Have you picked a Chief of Staff, Mr. President?	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
TRUMP	Yeah, we're interviewing a lot of — we have a lot of great people for Chief of Staff.	0
TRUMP	A lot of people want the job.	0
TRUMP	A lot of people want the job.	0
TRUMP	And I have some great people.	0
TRUMP	A lot of friends of mine want it.	0
TRUMP	A lot of people that Chuck and Nancy know very well want it.	0
TRUMP	I think people you'd like.	0
TRUMP	We have a lot of people that want the job — Chief of Staff.	0
TRUMP	So we'll be seeing what happens very soon.	0
TRUMP	We're in no rush.	0
TRUMP	We're in no rush.	0
QUESTION	Why?	0
QUESTION	Why no rush, Mr. President?	0
TRUMP	Why?	0
TRUMP	Because we have a wonderful Chief of Staff right now.	0
TRUMP	Just no — we are in no rush.	0
TRUMP	Over a period of a week or two, or maybe less, we'll announce who it's going to be.	0
TRUMP	But we have a lot of people that want the position.	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.	0
TRUMP	Thanks.	0
TRUMP	Thank you, Klaus, very much.	0
TRUMP	It’s a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy, and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security, and peace.	0
TRUMP	I’m here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm America’s friendship and partnership in building a better world.	0
TRUMP	Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear.	0
TRUMP	Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S.	0
TRUMP	We’re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream — the dream of a great job, a safe home, and a better life for their children.	0
TRUMP	After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth.	0
TRUMP	The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election.	0
TRUMP	Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades.	1
TRUMP	Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially.	1
TRUMP	Small-business optimism is at an all-time high.	0
TRUMP	New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century.	1
TRUMP	African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans.	1
TRUMP	The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.	0
TRUMP	I’m here to deliver a simple message:	0
TRUMP	There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States.	0
TRUMP	America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.	0
TRUMP	The American economy is by far the largest in the world, and we’ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history.	0
TRUMP	We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard-earned money.	0
TRUMP	We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent.	0
TRUMP	As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000.	0
TRUMP	The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000.	1
TRUMP	The world’s largest company, Apple, announced plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America.	0
TRUMP	Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years.	0
TRUMP	Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States.	0
TRUMP	This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived.	1
TRUMP	Regulation is stealth taxation.	0
TRUMP	The U.S., like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats — and we have — believe me, we have them all over the place — and they’ve imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability.	0
TRUMP	In America, those days are over.	0
TRUMP	I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation.	0
TRUMP	We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations.	0
TRUMP	Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every 1 new rule.	0
TRUMP	We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before.	0
TRUMP	We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production.	0
TRUMP	America is the place to do business.	0
TRUMP	So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build.	0
TRUMP	I believe in America.	0
TRUMP	As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also.	0
TRUMP	But America first does not mean America alone.	0
TRUMP	When the United States grows, so does the world.	0
TRUMP	American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives.	0
TRUMP	As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules.	0
TRUMP	We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.	0
TRUMP	We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.	0
TRUMP	Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all.	0
TRUMP	The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning.	0
TRUMP	These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe.	0
TRUMP	Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers.	0
TRUMP	We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system.	0
TRUMP	Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. but for all nations.	0
TRUMP	As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries.	0
TRUMP	This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important.	0
TRUMP	We have agreements with several of them already.	0
TRUMP	We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.	0
TRUMP	My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independence.	0
TRUMP	We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses, and to promote energy security for our friends all around the world.	0
TRUMP	No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy.	0
TRUMP	America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America.	0
TRUMP	We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.	0
TRUMP	We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.	0
TRUMP	We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable.	0
TRUMP	And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.	0
TRUMP	We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world.	0
TRUMP	Energy is abundant and affordable.	0
TRUMP	There has never been a better time to come to America.	0
TRUMP	We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security.	0
TRUMP	To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations.	0
TRUMP	Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.	0
TRUMP	My administration is proud to have led historic efforts, at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world, to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean Peninsula.	0
TRUMP	We continue to call on partners to confront Iran’s support for terrorists and block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.	0
TRUMP	We’re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so.	0
TRUMP	The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology.	0
TRUMP	I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.	1
TRUMP	There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains.	0
TRUMP	We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.	0
TRUMP	I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts.	0
TRUMP	You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people.	0
TRUMP	When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation.	0
TRUMP	We will defend our citizens and our borders.	0
TRUMP	We are also securing our immigration system, as a matter of both national and economic security.	0
TRUMP	America is a cutting-edge economy, but our immigration system is stuck in the past.	0
TRUMP	We must replace our current system of extended-family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country.	0
TRUMP	In rebuilding America, we are also fully committed to developing our workforce.	0
TRUMP	We are lifting people from dependence to independence, because we know the single best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck.	0
TRUMP	To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy.	0
TRUMP	We must invest in our people.	0
TRUMP	When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured.	0
TRUMP	Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all.	0
TRUMP	The nation’s greatness is more than the sum of its production.	0
TRUMP	A nation’s greatness is the sum of its citizens: the values, pride, love, devotion, and character of the people who call that nation home.	0
TRUMP	From my first international G7 Summit, to the G20, to the U.N. General Assembly, to APEC, to the World Trade Organization, and today at the World Economic Forum, my administration has not only been present, but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate toward shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams.	0
TRUMP	Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the world.	0
TRUMP	You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants, and many of the brightest minds in many fields.	0
TRUMP	Each of you has the power to change hearts, transform lives, and shape your countries’ destinies.	0
TRUMP	With this power comes an obligation, however — a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, and customers who have made you who you are.	0
TRUMP	So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people — to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams; to protect their families, their communities, their histories, and their futures.	0
TRUMP	That’s what we’re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable.	0
TRUMP	It’s why new businesses and investment are flooding in.	0
TRUMP	It’s why our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in so many decades.	0
TRUMP	It’s why America’s future has never been brighter.	0
TRUMP	Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together.	0
TRUMP	Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience.	0
TRUMP	But most importantly, thank you to all of the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone.	0
TRUMP	Together, let us send our love and our gratitude to make them, because they really make our countries run.	0
TRUMP	They make our countries great.	0
TRUMP	Thank you, and God bless you all.	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
MR. SCHWAB	Thank you, Mr. President, for this inspiring speech.	0
MR. SCHWAB	As it is tradition at the forum, I will ask you one or two questions.	0
MR. SCHWAB	And my first question is, why is the tax reform — why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?	0
TRUMP	Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you.	0
TRUMP	This is an incredible group of people.	0
TRUMP	We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years.	0
TRUMP	And it was truly an incredible group.	0
TRUMP	But I think I have 15 new friends.	0
TRUMP	So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum.	0
TRUMP	The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done.	0
TRUMP	Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform.	0
TRUMP	And ours is cutting and reforming.	0
TRUMP	We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.	0
TRUMP	We’ve wanted to do it.	0
TRUMP	It is very tough, politically, to do it.	0
TRUMP	Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.	0
TRUMP	That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.	0
TRUMP	And once we got it going, it was going.	0
TRUMP	And the big — and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies.	0
TRUMP	And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.	0
TRUMP	And even today they just announced many more.	0
TRUMP	But every day they announce more and more.	0
TRUMP	And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most.	0
TRUMP	It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000.	0
TRUMP	This is something that we didn’t anticipate.	0
TRUMP	Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate.	0
TRUMP	Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing.	0
TRUMP	This came out of nowhere.	0
TRUMP	Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.	0
TRUMP	It wasn’t in the equation.	0
TRUMP	We waited — we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in.	0
TRUMP	And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck — because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing.	0
TRUMP	And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be — well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in.	0
TRUMP	And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.	0
TRUMP	We’ve set 84 records since my election — record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period.	0
TRUMP	And that’s a great thing.	0
TRUMP	And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform.	0
TRUMP	So what happened is really something special.	0
TRUMP	Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion.	0
TRUMP	And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S.	0
TRUMP	And I will tell you, this moved up very substantially.	0
TRUMP	But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking — I thought they were talking $350 million.	0
TRUMP	And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant.	0
TRUMP	Not the greatest, but not bad.	0
TRUMP	And they said, “No, sir. It’s $350 billion.”	0
TRUMP	I said, that is something.	0
TRUMP	Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night — great companies.	0
TRUMP	They’re all investing.	0
TRUMP	When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” — because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars.	0
TRUMP	So I think you have a brand-new United States.	0
TRUMP	You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening.	0
TRUMP	And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them.	0
TRUMP	But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.	0
TRUMP	And we’re really doing — we had a great first year — so successful in so many different ways.	0
TRUMP	And there’s a tremendous spirit.	0
TRUMP	When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.	1
TRUMP	Same with Hispanic.	1
TRUMP	Women at a 17-year low.	1
TRUMP	It’s very heartwarming to see.	0
TRUMP	But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States.	0
TRUMP	I would say it’s a spirit like I have never witnessed before.	0
TRUMP	I’ve been here for awhile.	0
TRUMP	I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now.	0
TRUMP	So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much.	0
TRUMP	Thank you.	0
MR. SCHWAB	Mr. President, I will ask you, maybe, a personal question.	0
MR. SCHWAB	But before doing so, I’d just like to —	0
TRUMP	Sounds very interesting.	0
TRUMP	I didn’t know about this one.	0
MR. SCHWAB	I would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your Cabinet members	0
TRUMP	Yes.	0
MR. SCHWAB	— who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).	0
TRUMP	Good, I would like to do that.	0
TRUMP	That’s very nice.	0
MR. SCHWAB	Yeah.	0
MR. SCHWAB	Now —	0
TRUMP	Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know.	0
TRUMP	We’re making our military protection a little bit better for us too.	0
TRUMP	So thank you very much.	0
TRUMP	Does everybody understand that?	0
TRUMP	I think so.	0
TRUMP	Thank you all for being here.	0
MR. SCHWAB	Now my, maybe personal, question would be: What experience from your past have been most useful in preparing you for the Presidency?	0
TRUMP	Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me.	0
TRUMP	I’ve loved it.	0
TRUMP	I’ve always loved business.	0
TRUMP	I’ve always been good at building things, and I’ve always been successful at making money.	0
TRUMP	I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful.	0
TRUMP	And I’ve been good at it.	0
TRUMP	And that takes a certain ability.	0
TRUMP	And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.	0
TRUMP	It’s always been a general or a politician.	0
TRUMP	Throughout history, it’s always been a general — you had to be a general — but mostly it was politicians.	0
TRUMP	You never have a businessman.	0
TRUMP	And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.	1
TRUMP	That’s where we were heading.	0
TRUMP	I really believe that — because they were going to put on massive new regulations.	0
TRUMP	You couldn’t breathe.	0
TRUMP	It was choking our country to death.	0
TRUMP	And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson.	0
TRUMP	The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.	0
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
TRUMP	Throughout my whole life — somebody will explain someday why — but I’ve always gotten a lot.	0
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
TRUMP	And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press.	0
TRUMP	The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press.	0
TRUMP	And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be.	0
TRUMP	As the cameras start going off in the background.	0
SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
TRUMP	But overall — I mean, the bottom line — somebody said, well, they couldn’t have been that bad because here we are — we’re President.	0
TRUMP	And I think we’re doing a really great job with my team.	0
TRUMP	I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think we’re doing a very special job.	0
TRUMP	And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people.	0
TRUMP	We have a very pro-business group.	0
TRUMP	We have regulations cut to a level — in the history of our country, Klaus — this was reported recently.	0
TRUMP	In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case.	0
TRUMP	We’ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go.	0
TRUMP	I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done.	0
TRUMP	And we’re going to have regulation.	0
TRUMP	There’s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them.	0
TRUMP	But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go.	0
TRUMP	So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something.	0
TRUMP	And one other thing I said — and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople — I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work.	0
TRUMP	And the reason I’m a cheerleader is because it’s easy — because I love our country and I think we’re just doing really well.	0
TRUMP	And we look forward to seeing you in America — special place — and where you are is a special place also.	0
TRUMP	Thank you all very much.	0
TRUMP	I appreciate it.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
MR. SCHWAB	Thank you.	0
MR. SCHWAB	Thank you very much, Mr. President, for being with us.	0
MR. SCHWAB	The World Economic Forum community, who is assembled here, will be certainly — and I quote you from the last piece of your remarks — will be certainly among “the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day making this world a better place for everyone.”	0
MR. SCHWAB	Thank you very much for being with us.	0
TRUMP	Thank you.	0
TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.	0
TRUMP	Thank you.	0
SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
TRUMP	My fellow Americans:	0
TRUMP	Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.	1
TRUMP	Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.	0
TRUMP	We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.	0
TRUMP	America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.	0
TRUMP	But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.	1
TRUMP	It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.	1
TRUMP	Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.	0
TRUMP	Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.	1
TRUMP	Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border.	0
TRUMP	More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.	0
TRUMP	In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.	1
TRUMP	Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.	1
TRUMP	This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.	0
TRUMP	Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase.	0
TRUMP	These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.	0
TRUMP	One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.	0
TRUMP	Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.	0
TRUMP	This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.	0
TRUMP	This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.	0
TRUMP	My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.	0
TRUMP	It’s a tremendous problem.	0
TRUMP	Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.	0
TRUMP	These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.	0
TRUMP	In fact, safer than ever before.	0
TRUMP	The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.	0
TRUMP	We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.	0
TRUMP	Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.	0
TRUMP	Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.	0
TRUMP	Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.	1
TRUMP	At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.	1
TRUMP	This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.	0
TRUMP	It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.	0
TRUMP	This is just common sense.	0
TRUMP	The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.	0
TRUMP	The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.	0
TRUMP	The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.	1
TRUMP	Senator Chuck Schumer — who you will be hearing from later tonight — has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats.	0
TRUMP	They changed their mind only after I was elected President.	0
TRUMP	Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis.	0
TRUMP	And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.	0
TRUMP	The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.	0
TRUMP	My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.	0
TRUMP	But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.	0
TRUMP	This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.	0
TRUMP	I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.	0
TRUMP	Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.	0
TRUMP	Some have suggested a barrier is immoral.	0
TRUMP	Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?	0
TRUMP	They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.	0
TRUMP	The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.	0
TRUMP	America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border.	0
TRUMP	The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.	0
TRUMP	Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.	0
TRUMP	In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history.	0
TRUMP	In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor.	0
TRUMP	In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.	0
TRUMP	Over the last several years, I’ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration.	0
TRUMP	I’ve held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers.	0
TRUMP	So sad.	0
TRUMP	So terrible.	0
TRUMP	I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.	0
TRUMP	How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?	0
TRUMP	To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?	0
TRUMP	To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.	0
TRUMP	To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.	0
TRUMP	This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.	0
TRUMP	This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.	0
TRUMP	When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country.	0
TRUMP	And that is what I will always do, so help me God.	0
TRUMP	Thank you and goodnight.	0
