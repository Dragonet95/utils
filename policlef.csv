0	1.0		TODD	Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.
0	2.0		MADDOW	We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire.
0	3.0		MADDOW	Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this.
0	4.0		MADDOW	Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.
0	5.0		TODD	And neither party has seen this yet.
0	6.0		TODD	These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president.
0	7.0		TODD	Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.
0	8.0		MADDOW	And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions -- show us the differences between them.
0	9.0		MADDOW	That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.
0	10.0		MADDOW	We're not here for talking points.
0	11.0		MADDOW	We're to learn about the difference between the candidates.
0	12.0		MADDOW	And with that, let's get going.
0	13.0		MADDOW	Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.
0	14.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	15.0		TODD	First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight.
0	16.0		TODD	The rules tonight, by the way, are simple
0	17.0		TODD	90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.
0	18.0		MADDOW	And with that, that's it.
0	19.0		MADDOW	We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates.
0	20.0		MADDOW	And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.
0	21.0		SANDERS	Rachel, thank you very much.
0	22.0		SANDERS	Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process.
0	23.0		SANDERS	And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.
1	24.0		SANDERS	They are working longer hours for low wages.
1	25.0		SANDERS	They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.
0	26.0		SANDERS	Not what America is supposed to be about.
0	27.0		SANDERS	Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about.
0	28.0		SANDERS	And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.
0	29.0		SANDERS	Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United.
0	30.0		SANDERS	One person, one vote.
0	31.0		SANDERS	That's what American democracy is about.
0	32.0		TODD	Thank you, Senator.
0	33.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton.
0	34.0		CLINTON	Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.
0	35.0		CLINTON	I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed.
0	36.0		CLINTON	And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.
0	37.0		CLINTON	Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans.
0	38.0		CLINTON	Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.
0	39.0		CLINTON	But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.
0	40.0		CLINTON	I believe that we can get back on the right track.
0	41.0		CLINTON	I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.
0	42.0		CLINTON	I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.
0	43.0		TODD	All right.
0	44.0		TODD	Let's get started.
0	45.0		TODD	"Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable."""
0	46.0		TODD	So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.
0	47.0		CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals.
0	48.0		CLINTON	I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it.
0	49.0		CLINTON	I don't want us to start over again.
0	50.0		CLINTON	I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.
0	51.0		CLINTON	I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.
0	52.0		CLINTON	And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.
0	53.0		CLINTON	So we have a difference.
0	54.0		CLINTON	I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.
0	55.0		CLINTON	What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college.
0	56.0		CLINTON	I want to get the economy going again.
0	57.0		CLINTON	It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is.
0	58.0		CLINTON	I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power.
0	59.0		CLINTON	I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.
0	60.0		CLINTON	And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work.
0	61.0		CLINTON	But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing.
0	62.0		CLINTON	That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.
0	63.0		CLINTON	Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.
0	64.0		CLINTON	A progressive is someone who makes progress.
0	65.0		CLINTON	That's what I intend to do.
0	66.0		TODD	Thank you, Secretary.
0	67.0		TODD	Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.
0	68.0		TODD	Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?
0	69.0		SANDERS	Well, I haven't quite run for president before.
0	70.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	71.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	72.0		SANDERS	Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.
0	73.0		SANDERS	And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here.
0	74.0		SANDERS	I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.
0	75.0		SANDERS	Here is the issue.
0	76.0		SANDERS	Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are.
0	77.0		SANDERS	So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.
0	78.0		SANDERS	I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0	79.0		SANDERS	Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce.
0	80.0		SANDERS	This is 2016.
0	81.0		SANDERS	When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade.
0	82.0		SANDERS	I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.
0	83.0		SANDERS	Well, how do we pay for that?
0	84.0		SANDERS	It's an expensive proposition.
0	85.0		SANDERS	I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people.
0	86.0		SANDERS	We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0	87.0		SANDERS	The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.
0	88.0		SANDERS	Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.
0	89.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	90.0		CLINTON	If I could just follow up on that.
0	91.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	92.0		CLINTON	There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.
0	93.0		CLINTON	The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it.
0	94.0		CLINTON	I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down.
0	95.0		CLINTON	Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.
0	96.0		CLINTON	This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country.
0	97.0		CLINTON	It is helping people right now.
0	98.0		CLINTON	I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.
0	99.0		CLINTON	Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.
0	100.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	101.0		SANDERS	Let me...
0	102.0		TODD	Go.
0	103.0		SANDERS	... this is a good discussion here.
0	104.0		TODD	Yes, go ahead.
0	105.0		SANDERS	And let me just say this.
0	106.0		SANDERS	As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee.
0	107.0		SANDERS	That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.
0	108.0		SANDERS	The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.
0	109.0		SANDERS	The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.
0	110.0		SANDERS	So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here -- I helped write that bill -- but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.
0	111.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	112.0		TODD	All right, thank you both.
0	113.0		TODD	Rachel.
0	114.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee.
0	115.0		MADDOW	He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.
0	116.0		MADDOW	Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?
0	117.0		CLINTON	Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.
0	118.0		CLINTON	And the root of that word, progressive, is progress.
0	119.0		CLINTON	But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.
0	120.0		CLINTON	Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact.
0	121.0		CLINTON	Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.
0	122.0		CLINTON	You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country.
0	123.0		CLINTON	But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.
0	124.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	125.0		CLINTON	I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0	126.0		CLINTON	I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.
0	127.0		CLINTON	So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do.
0	128.0		CLINTON	That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress.
0	129.0		CLINTON	That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.
0	130.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	131.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?
0	132.0		SANDERS	No, not at all.
0	133.0		SANDERS	Here's the reality of American economic life today.
0	134.0		SANDERS	The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.
1	135.0		SANDERS	The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.
0	136.0		SANDERS	The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.
0	137.0		SANDERS	So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors.
0	138.0		SANDERS	Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas.
0	139.0		SANDERS	Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States.
0	140.0		SANDERS	Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.
0	141.0		SANDERS	That is not a radical idea.
0	142.0		SANDERS	What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors.
0	143.0		SANDERS	When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.
0	144.0		MADDOW	Thank you Senator.
0	145.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	146.0		TODD	I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator.
0	147.0		TODD	President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.
0	148.0		TODD	President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both.
0	149.0		TODD	Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?
0	150.0		SANDERS	Let me just pick up on this point.
0	151.0		SANDERS	This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary.
0	152.0		SANDERS	She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been -- I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate.
0	153.0		SANDERS	Well, I am a moderate.
0	154.0		SANDERS	That's where this came from.
0	155.0		SANDERS	It wasn't me paraphrasing her.
0	156.0		SANDERS	It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate.
0	157.0		SANDERS	But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.
0	158.0		SANDERS	In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.
0	159.0		SANDERS	The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.
0	160.0		SANDERS	I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job.
0	161.0		SANDERS	We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago.
0	162.0		SANDERS	That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.
0	163.0		SANDERS	Do I think President Obama is a progressive?
0	164.0		SANDERS	Yes, I do.
0	165.0		SANDERS	I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.
0	166.0		SANDERS	But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.
0	167.0		CLINTON	Well, Chuck...
0	168.0		TODD	... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...
0	169.0		CLINTON	If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.
0	170.0		CLINTON	Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.
0	171.0		CLINTON	It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies.
0	172.0		CLINTON	Before it was called Hillarycare -- I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program.
0	173.0		CLINTON	Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.
0	174.0		CLINTON	So, again...
0	175.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	176.0		CLINTON	I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself.
0	177.0		CLINTON	I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be -- in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.
0	178.0		CLINTON	It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.
0	179.0		CLINTON	And, that's what we ought to be celebrating.
0	180.0		CLINTON	Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.
0	181.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	182.0		TODD	(inaudible) 30 seconds, and then we'll move.
0	183.0		SANDERS	That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about...
0	184.0		CLINTON	... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...
0	185.0		SANDERS	... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk.
0	186.0		SANDERS	I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...
0	187.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	188.0		SANDERS	... And special interests.
0	189.0		SANDERS	I am enormously proud.
0	190.0		SANDERS	Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece.
0	191.0		SANDERS	That is what the political revolution means.
0	192.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	193.0		TODD	Thank you.
0	194.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire.
0	195.0		MADDOW	But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.
0	196.0		MADDOW	In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.
0	197.0		MADDOW	How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?
0	198.0		SANDERS	Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate.
0	199.0		SANDERS	In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points.
0	200.0		SANDERS	I came in second.
0	201.0		SANDERS	It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat.
0	202.0		SANDERS	In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me.
0	203.0		SANDERS	And it is true...
0	204.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	205.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	206.0		SANDERS	It is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress.
0	207.0		SANDERS	People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent.
0	208.0		SANDERS	That is true.
0	209.0		SANDERS	But on the other hand, I have -- when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats.
0	210.0		SANDERS	In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course.
0	211.0		SANDERS	And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of.
0	212.0		SANDERS	And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.
0	213.0		SANDERS	I am running for president as a Democrat.
0	214.0		SANDERS	And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.
0	215.0		SANDERS	I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now.
0	216.0		SANDERS	And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.
0	217.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	218.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton.
0	219.0		CLINTON	You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.
0	220.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	221.0		CLINTON	And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials.
0	222.0		CLINTON	Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator.
0	223.0		CLINTON	I really appreciate that.
0	224.0		CLINTON	And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do.
0	225.0		CLINTON	They know what kind of a colleague I am.
0	226.0		CLINTON	They want me as their partner in the White House.
0	227.0		CLINTON	And that's exactly what I will do.
0	228.0		CLINTON	We'll get things done together.
0	229.0		CLINTON	Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president.
0	230.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	231.0		MADDOW	So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats.
0	232.0		MADDOW	She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best.
0	233.0		SANDERS	Well, I don't see it quite like that.
0	234.0		MADDOW	How do you see it?
0	235.0		SANDERS	I am -- will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House.
0	236.0		SANDERS	She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her.
0	237.0		SANDERS	That's a fact.
0	238.0		SANDERS	I don't deny it.
0	239.0		SANDERS	But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece.
0	240.0		SANDERS	That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out.
0	241.0		SANDERS	That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.
0	242.0		SANDERS	So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment.
0	243.0		SANDERS	I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.
0	244.0		MADDOW	Secretary.
0	245.0		CLINTON	Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.
0	246.0		CLINTON	And I've got to tell you that it is...
0	247.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	248.0		CLINTON	It is really quite amusing to me.
0	249.0		CLINTON	People support me because they know me.
0	250.0		CLINTON	They know my life's work.
0	251.0		CLINTON	They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders.
0	252.0		CLINTON	And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.
0	253.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	254.0		CLINTON	I am not going to make promises I can't keep.
0	255.0		CLINTON	I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.
0	256.0		CLINTON	A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.
0	257.0		CLINTON	I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead.
0	258.0		CLINTON	That is not my agenda.
0	259.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	260.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that.
0	261.0		SANDERS	What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.
0	262.0		SANDERS	To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.
0	263.0		CLINTON	Yeah, but I -- I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment.
0	264.0		CLINTON	You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign.
0	265.0		CLINTON	I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.
0	266.0		CLINTON	But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to -- you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.
0	267.0		CLINTON	And I just absolutely reject that, Senator.
0	268.0		CLINTON	And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you.
0	269.0		CLINTON	And enough is enough.
0	270.0		CLINTON	If you've got something to say, say it directly.
0	271.0		CLINTON	But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.
0	272.0		SANDERS	What...
0	273.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	274.0		CLINTON	And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that.
0	275.0		SANDERS	... you know...
0	276.0		CLINTON	So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...
0	277.0		SANDERS	(inaudible).
0	278.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	279.0		CLINTON	... in recent weeks, and let's talk...
0	280.0		SYSTEM	(BOOING)
0	281.0		CLINTON	... let's talk about about the issues.
0	282.0		CLINTON	Let's talk about the issues that divide us.
0	283.0		SANDERS	Let's talk about -- OK, let's talk...
0	284.0		CLINTON	And let's -- let's...
0	285.0		SANDERS	... let us talk about issues.
0	286.0		CLINTON	... we both agree with campaign finance reform.
0	287.0		SANDERS	Let's talk about issues.
0	288.0		CLINTON	I -- I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.
0	289.0		SANDERS	Let's...
0	290.0		CLINTON	I want to reverse Citizens United.
0	291.0		SANDERS	... let's -- let's -- let's talk about issues.
0	292.0		CLINTON	And so -- let's talk about issues.
0	293.0		SANDERS	Let's talk -- let's talk about issues, all right?
0	294.0		SANDERS	Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated.
0	295.0		SANDERS	Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided -- spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?
0	296.0		SANDERS	Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.
0	297.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	298.0		SANDERS	Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.
0	299.0		SANDERS	You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry?
0	300.0		SANDERS	Let's talk about climate change.
1	301.0		SANDERS	Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system?
0	302.0		SANDERS	Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?
0	303.0		SANDERS	That is what goes on in America.
0	304.0		SANDERS	I am not -- I like...
0	305.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	306.0		SANDERS	... there is a reason.
0	307.0		SANDERS	You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system.
0	308.0		SANDERS	And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.
0	309.0		CLINTON	Well, you know, Senator, I don't think -- I don't...
0	310.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	311.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	312.0		TODD	... Secretary, we're gonna...
0	313.0		CLINTON	I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.
0	314.0		CLINTON	And I'm proud of that.
0	315.0		CLINTON	You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.
0	316.0		CLINTON	Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you.
0	317.0		CLINTON	I know this game.
0	318.0		CLINTON	I'm going to stop this game.
0	319.0		CLINTON	But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.
0	320.0		CLINTON	So I don't know -- I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.
0	321.0		CLINTON	People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage.
0	322.0		CLINTON	What we've got to do as Democrats -- what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems.
0	323.0		CLINTON	And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.
0	324.0		CLINTON	That's what this election should be about.
0	325.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	326.0		TODD	Thirty seconds.
0	327.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	328.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	329.0		SANDERS	I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder.
0	330.0		SANDERS	I was on the House Financial Committee at that time.
0	331.0		SANDERS	I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans -- Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan -- about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.
0	332.0		SANDERS	Go to YouTube today.
0	333.0		SANDERS	Look up Greenspan-Sanders.
0	334.0		SANDERS	Listen to what I told them then.
0	335.0		SANDERS	I helped lead the effort against deregulation.
0	336.0		SANDERS	Unfortunately, we lost that.
0	337.0		SANDERS	The result is -- was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.
0	338.0		TODD	Thank you both.
0	339.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we've touched a nerve.
0	340.0		MADDOW	We're going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this.
0	341.0		MADDOW	Stay with us.
0	342.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	343.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	344.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	345.0		TODD	All right, welcome back.
0	346.0		TODD	Let's get right to it.
0	347.0		TODD	Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform.
0	348.0		TODD	You rail against big money in politics.
0	349.0		TODD	But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is -- it is in place to run for president.
0	350.0		TODD	Why aren't you walking the walk on that?
0	351.0		TODD	Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?
0	352.0		SANDERS	Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster.
0	353.0		SANDERS	The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well.
0	354.0		SANDERS	But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work.
0	355.0		SANDERS	Your point is well taken.
0	356.0		SANDERS	I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely.
0	357.0		SANDERS	But this system is -- I don't know if the secretary would agree -- is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.
0	358.0		TODD	Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got -- and all this when it is -- you know, that's the system?
0	359.0		TODD	I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing -- public financing system...
0	360.0		SANDERS	But if the...
0	361.0		TODD	... and being able to set -- being able to set an example.
0	362.0		SANDERS	-- but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated.
0	363.0		SANDERS	It no longer works.
0	364.0		SANDERS	Nobody can become president based on that system.
0	365.0		SANDERS	So what's the alternative?
0	366.0		SANDERS	There are two alternatives.
0	367.0		SANDERS	And, you know, we looked at it.
0	368.0		SANDERS	Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.
0	369.0		SANDERS	So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign.
0	370.0		SANDERS	And you know what?
0	371.0		SANDERS	We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece.
0	372.0		SANDERS	I think that's pretty good.
0	373.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	374.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...
0	375.0		CLINTON	On the issue of Wall Street.
0	376.0		MADDOW	... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.
0	377.0		MADDOW	Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that's what they offered.
0	378.0		MADDOW	Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?
0	379.0		CLINTON	Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record.
0	380.0		CLINTON	You know, I did -- when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit.
0	381.0		CLINTON	I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street.
0	382.0		CLINTON	They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.
0	383.0		CLINTON	But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash.
0	384.0		CLINTON	I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.
0	385.0		CLINTON	I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy.
0	386.0		CLINTON	I proposed changes in CEO compensation.
0	387.0		CLINTON	I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created.
0	388.0		CLINTON	And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.
0	389.0		CLINTON	They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads.
0	390.0		CLINTON	Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.
0	391.0		CLINTON	And why are they doing that?
0	392.0		CLINTON	These are guys who try to make smart investments.
0	393.0		CLINTON	They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it.
0	394.0		CLINTON	And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.
0	395.0		CLINTON	So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.
0	396.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	397.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street.
0	398.0		MADDOW	What about her defense of her record?
0	399.0		SANDERS	Let me just say this.
0	400.0		SANDERS	Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.
0	401.0		SANDERS	You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.
0	402.0		SANDERS	Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.
0	403.0		SANDERS	But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.
0	404.0		SANDERS	These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.
0	405.0		SANDERS	Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record.
0	406.0		SANDERS	A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record.
0	407.0		SANDERS	That is what power is about.
0	408.0		SANDERS	That is what corruption is about.
0	409.0		SANDERS	And that is what has to change in the United States of America.
0	410.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	411.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	412.0		CLINTON	If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change.
0	413.0		CLINTON	It has to change.
0	414.0		CLINTON	And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.
0	415.0		CLINTON	And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.
0	416.0		CLINTON	I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.
0	417.0		CLINTON	But I do not believe that that is enough.
0	418.0		CLINTON	And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.
0	419.0		CLINTON	You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks.
0	420.0		CLINTON	And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.
0	421.0		CLINTON	But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.
0	422.0		CLINTON	So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.
0	423.0		CLINTON	We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.
0	424.0		CLINTON	My plan takes us further and it would do the job.
0	425.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	426.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	427.0		SANDERS	I would say that -- that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0	428.0		SANDERS	And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were -- significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.
0	429.0		SANDERS	And that is what I believe and many economists believe.
0	430.0		SANDERS	Time to break them up.
0	431.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	432.0		CLINTON	Look we have a law -- look, you know, I -- I appreciate the senator's advocacy.
0	433.0		CLINTON	We have a law.
0	434.0		CLINTON	It was passed.
0	435.0		CLINTON	It was signed by President Obama.
0	436.0		CLINTON	It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.
0	437.0		CLINTON	And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president.
0	438.0		CLINTON	So we have a law in place.
0	439.0		CLINTON	If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it.
0	440.0		CLINTON	And from what you say, I know you will as well.
0	441.0		CLINTON	But that is not enough.
1	442.0		CLINTON	And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me -- the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys -- is because I've got their number on all of that.
0	443.0		CLINTON	And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.
0	444.0		CLINTON	You know, we can't just fight the last war.
0	445.0		CLINTON	We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans.
0	446.0		CLINTON	And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.
0	447.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	448.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	449.0		TODD	... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.
0	450.0		SANDERS	Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation.
0	451.0		SANDERS	And here's where we are.
0	452.0		SANDERS	The American people can judge.
0	453.0		SANDERS	Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.
0	454.0		SANDERS	That is a lot of money.
0	455.0		SANDERS	They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.
0	456.0		SANDERS	That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.
0	457.0		SANDERS	That's it.
0	458.0		SANDERS	I think it is too much power.
0	459.0		SANDERS	Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.
0	460.0		TODD	Thank you both.
0	461.0		TODD	Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.
0	462.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, it's addressed to you, and it's about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs.
0	463.0		TODD	This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.
0	464.0		TODD	"I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, ""Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?"""
0	465.0		TODD	But, let's make that bigger.
0	466.0		TODD	Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches?
0	467.0		TODD	We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches.
0	468.0		TODD	In full disclosure, would you release all of them?
0	469.0		CLINTON	I will look into it.
0	470.0		CLINTON	I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it.
0	471.0		CLINTON	But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs.
0	472.0		CLINTON	I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.
0	473.0		CLINTON	My view on this is look at my record.
0	474.0		CLINTON	Look at what I am proposing, and -- we have a vigorous agreement here.
0	475.0		CLINTON	We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street.
0	476.0		CLINTON	I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.
0	477.0		CLINTON	I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health.
0	478.0		CLINTON	Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies.
0	479.0		CLINTON	We're missing other big energy companies.
0	480.0		CLINTON	We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.
0	481.0		TODD	Senator, you sound like you want to respond.
0	482.0		TODD	Go ahead.
0	483.0		SANDERS	Yeah, I do.
0	484.0		SANDERS	I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak.
0	485.0		SANDERS	Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.
0	486.0		SANDERS	That's a fact.
0	487.0		SANDERS	And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people.
0	488.0		SANDERS	In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0	489.0		SANDERS	It's fraud.
0	490.0		SANDERS	I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...
0	491.0		CLINTON	... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen.
0	492.0		CLINTON	I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.
0	493.0		CLINTON	This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again.
0	494.0		CLINTON	We have no disagreement about this.
0	495.0		CLINTON	But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people.
0	496.0		CLINTON	And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.
0	497.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system.
0	498.0		MADDOW	You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart.
0	499.0		MADDOW	But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans.
0	500.0		MADDOW	That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business.
0	501.0		MADDOW	The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.
0	502.0		MADDOW	Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign?
0	503.0		SANDERS	Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear.
0	504.0		SANDERS	When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage.
0	505.0		SANDERS	I suspect the secretary agrees request me.
0	506.0		SANDERS	Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.
0	507.0		SANDERS	And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year?
0	508.0		SANDERS	Zero.
0	509.0		SANDERS	Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.
0	510.0		SANDERS	So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?
0	511.0		SANDERS	We're going to end that loophole.
0	512.0		SANDERS	They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.
0	513.0		SANDERS	We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.
0	514.0		SANDERS	Can I work with corporations?
0	515.0		SANDERS	Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?
0	516.0		SANDERS	Absolutely they are.
0	517.0		SANDERS	And we should be proud of them.
0	518.0		SANDERS	But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.
0	519.0		SANDERS	I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.
0	520.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	521.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, thank you.
0	522.0		MADDOW	And with that, we're going to take a break.
0	523.0		TODD	We'll be right back.
0	524.0		TODD	And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.
0	525.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	526.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	527.0		MADDOW	Welcome back -- welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate.
0	528.0		MADDOW	We're going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.
0	529.0		MADDOW	And Secretary Clinton, we're going to start with you.
0	530.0		MADDOW	There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS.
0	531.0		MADDOW	It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.
0	532.0		MADDOW	Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?
0	533.0		CLINTON	Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.
0	534.0		CLINTON	I agree with the president.
0	535.0		CLINTON	I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq -- that is off the table.
0	536.0		CLINTON	But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.
0	537.0		CLINTON	And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting.
0	538.0		CLINTON	We're doing the support and enabling.
0	539.0		CLINTON	And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.
0	540.0		So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep -- try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW	To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americans -- an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?
0	541.0		CLINTON	No.
0	542.0		CLINTON	I mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are.
0	543.0		CLINTON	I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.
0	544.0		CLINTON	I support special forces.
0	545.0		CLINTON	I support trainers.
0	546.0		CLINTON	I support the air campaign.
0	547.0		CLINTON	And I think we're making some progress.
0	548.0		CLINTON	I want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing.
0	549.0		MADDOW	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
0	550.0		TODD	Go ahead, Senator Sanders -- 30 seconds, your response.
0	551.0		SANDERS	OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.
0	552.0		SANDERS	Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002.
0	553.0		SANDERS	And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.
0	554.0		TODD	All right.
0	555.0		TODD	Senator, I want to stay, though...
0	556.0		CLINTON	If I could -- if I could...
0	557.0		TODD	Go ahead.
0	558.0		TODD	30 seconds.
0	559.0		CLINTON	... respectfully add -- look, we did differ.
0	560.0		CLINTON	A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.
0	561.0		CLINTON	We have to look at the threats that we face right now...
0	562.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	563.0		CLINTON	... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.
0	564.0		TODD	Let me -- let -- we're gonna -- we're staying -- we're staying basically on this topic.
0	565.0		TODD	Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.
0	566.0		TODD	Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan.
0	567.0		TODD	How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?
0	568.0		SANDERS	Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq.
0	569.0		SANDERS	And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.
0	570.0		SANDERS	I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen -- and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said.
0	571.0		SANDERS	I think he hit the nail on the head.
0	572.0		SANDERS	And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.
0	573.0		SANDERS	And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers -- U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.
0	574.0		SANDERS	So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate.
0	575.0		SANDERS	"But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans."""
0	576.0		SANDERS	The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support.
0	577.0		SANDERS	We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0	578.0		TODD	Can you address a question on Afghanistan?
0	579.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	580.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	581.0		TODD	How long are these troops going to be there?
0	582.0		TODD	If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they're going to be there?
0	583.0		SANDERS	Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow.
0	584.0		SANDERS	Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country.
0	585.0		SANDERS	But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi.
0	586.0		SANDERS	ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.
0	587.0		SANDERS	Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.
0	588.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan?
0	589.0		TODD	We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.
0	590.0		CLINTON	Oh, absolutely.
0	591.0		CLINTON	The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan.
0	592.0		CLINTON	We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top -- his top partner, Abdullah.
0	593.0		CLINTON	And they are doing their very best.
0	594.0		CLINTON	And the Afghan army is actually fighting.
0	595.0		CLINTON	The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.
0	596.0		CLINTON	And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need.
0	597.0		CLINTON	Because it's not just the Taliban.
0	598.0		CLINTON	We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.
0	599.0		CLINTON	So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it.
0	600.0		CLINTON	And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.
0	601.0		TODD	You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are.
0	602.0		TODD	You haven't given a major foreign policy speech.
0	603.0		TODD	And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you're asked about it, and you say you're going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.
0	604.0		TODD	You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet.
0	605.0		TODD	Why?
0	606.0		SANDERS	Well, that's not quite accurate.
0	607.0		SANDERS	I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy.
0	608.0		SANDERS	Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention.
0	609.0		SANDERS	So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.
0	610.0		SANDERS	I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq.
0	611.0		SANDERS	And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone.
0	612.0		SANDERS	We cannot be the policeman of the world.
0	613.0		SANDERS	We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense.
0	614.0		SANDERS	We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.
0	615.0		SANDERS	So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.
0	616.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	617.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	618.0		CLINTON	A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel.
0	619.0		CLINTON	Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.
0	620.0		CLINTON	So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.
0	621.0		CLINTON	And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.
0	622.0		TODD	All right, Senator, 30 seconds.
0	623.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	624.0		SANDERS	(OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience -- hat is not arguable -- in foreign affairs.
0	625.0		SANDERS	But experience is not the only point, judgment is.
0	626.0		SANDERS	And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't.
0	627.0		SANDERS	In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other.
0	628.0		SANDERS	That's no great secret.
0	629.0		SANDERS	But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.
0	630.0		CLINTON	Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State.
0	631.0		CLINTON	And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.
0	632.0		CLINTON	Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one.
0	633.0		CLINTON	There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can.
0	634.0		CLINTON	That is just not an acceptable approach.
0	635.0		SANDERS	Well...
0	636.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, at the -- at the last Democratic debate in Charleston -- I want to get specific here -- Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.
0	637.0		MADDOW	Your campaign has criticized him for saying that.
0	638.0		MADDOW	Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?
0	639.0		CLINTON	Absolutely.
0	640.0		CLINTON	You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions.
0	641.0		CLINTON	I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.
0	642.0		CLINTON	I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.
0	643.0		CLINTON	It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program.
0	644.0		CLINTON	We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it.
0	645.0		CLINTON	But that is not our only problem with Iran.
0	646.0		CLINTON	We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.
0	647.0		CLINTON	They are destabilizing governments in the region.
0	648.0		CLINTON	They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel.
0	649.0		CLINTON	A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard.
0	650.0		CLINTON	I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.
0	651.0		CLINTON	If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior.
0	652.0		CLINTON	The president doesn't think we should.
0	653.0		CLINTON	I certainly don't think we should.
0	654.0		CLINTON	I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.
0	655.0		SANDERS	Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow?
0	656.0		SANDERS	I never said that.
0	657.0		SANDERS	I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.
0	658.0		SANDERS	And you're right.
0	659.0		SANDERS	They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that.
0	660.0		SANDERS	But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea.
0	661.0		SANDERS	They're Communists, they are our enemy.
0	662.0		SANDERS	Well guess what?
0	663.0		SANDERS	Change has come.
0	664.0		SANDERS	So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow.
0	665.0		SANDERS	We don't.
0	666.0		SANDERS	But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen.
0	667.0		SANDERS	And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong.
1	668.0		SANDERS	When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.
0	669.0		SANDERS	I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.
0	670.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	671.0		CLINTON	Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can.
0	672.0		CLINTON	You know -- let me correct the record.
0	673.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	674.0		TODD	30 seconds, madam secretary.
0	675.0		CLINTON	As I -- as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions.
0	676.0		CLINTON	And you're right, I was against that.
0	677.0		CLINTON	I was against it then I would be against it now.
0	678.0		SANDERS	OK.
0	679.0		CLINTON	Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants.
0	680.0		CLINTON	"Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, ""Here I am. Let's talk and make a deal."""
0	681.0		CLINTON	That's not the way it works.
0	682.0		SANDERS	I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions.
0	683.0		SANDERS	But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...
0	684.0		CLINTON	... Well, we set conditions on Iran.
0	685.0		CLINTON	We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked.
0	686.0		CLINTON	That's exactly the right...
0	687.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	688.0		CLINTON	... And, that's what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.
0	689.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	690.0		SANDERS	Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.
0	691.0		TODD	Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you've got to prioritize potential threats to the United States.
0	692.0		TODD	Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia.
0	693.0		TODD	How would you rank them in order of their threat to America's security right now...
0	694.0		SANDERS	... ISIS...
0	695.0		TODD	Starting with the biggest threat.
0	696.0		SANDERS	ISIS, you forgot one...
0	697.0		TODD	I didn't say that...
0	698.0		SANDERS	... No, no...
0	699.0		TODD	... No...
0	700.0		SANDERS	... ISIS would be ...
0	701.0		TODD	... We already had that.
0	702.0		TODD	I'm talking about these three countries.
0	703.0		TODD	How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.
0	704.0		SANDERS	Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid.
0	705.0		SANDERS	And, who had nuclear weapons.
0	706.0		SANDERS	And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure.
0	707.0		SANDERS	China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China.
0	708.0		SANDERS	I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.
0	709.0		SANDERS	I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.
0	710.0		TODD	Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat.
0	711.0		TODD	Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that.
0	712.0		TODD	Do you agree with his decisions...
0	713.0		SANDERS	... No, I don't.
0	714.0		SANDERS	I worry very, very much about an isolated country.
0	715.0		SANDERS	That's what makes me nervous.
0	716.0		SANDERS	Russia lives in the world.
0	717.0		SANDERS	China lives in the world.
0	718.0		SANDERS	North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with.
0	719.0		SANDERS	Dealt with effectively.
0	720.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.
0	721.0		TODD	He's basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.
0	722.0		CLINTON	I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning.
0	723.0		CLINTON	We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on.
0	724.0		CLINTON	We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.
0	725.0		CLINTON	We do have to worry about North Korea.
0	726.0		CLINTON	They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.
0	727.0		CLINTON	And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast.
0	728.0		CLINTON	We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.
0	729.0		CLINTON	But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies.
0	730.0		CLINTON	The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe.
0	731.0		CLINTON	The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea.
0	732.0		CLINTON	Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.
0	733.0		CLINTON	We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East.
0	734.0		CLINTON	They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria.
0	735.0		CLINTON	They want to hang on to that.
0	736.0		CLINTON	I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense.
0	737.0		CLINTON	We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to.
0	738.0		CLINTON	The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense.
0	739.0		TODD	Thank you both, Rachel?
0	740.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home.
0	741.0		MADDOW	There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.
0	742.0		MADDOW	If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A.
0	743.0		MADDOW	It's a newly popular idea in conservative politics.
0	744.0		MADDOW	How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A.
0	745.0		MADDOW	in the last few years?
0	746.0		MADDOW	What's your argument that the V.A.
0	747.0		MADDOW	should still exist and should not be privatized?
0	748.0		CLINTON	Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A.
0	749.0		CLINTON	And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.
0	750.0		CLINTON	There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.
0	751.0		CLINTON	But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda.
0	752.0		CLINTON	They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.
0	753.0		CLINTON	I will fight that as hard as I can.
0	754.0		CLINTON	I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.
0	755.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	756.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues.
0	757.0		MADDOW	Is the right contour of the fight, the way she's talking about this issue?
0	758.0		SANDERS	Let me agree.
0	759.0		SANDERS	You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired -- I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
0	760.0		SANDERS	And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans.
0	761.0		SANDERS	I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America.
0	762.0		SANDERS	That's what I did.
0	763.0		SANDERS	And I brought it to the floor of the Senate.
0	764.0		SANDERS	Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans.
0	765.0		SANDERS	We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed.
0	766.0		SANDERS	That is pathetic.
0	767.0		SANDERS	This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.
0	768.0		SANDERS	So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.
0	769.0		SANDERS	What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise.
0	770.0		SANDERS	I did work with John McCain.
0	771.0		SANDERS	I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House.
0	772.0		SANDERS	And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A.
0	773.0		SANDERS	health care bill in the modern history of this country.
0	774.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers.
0	775.0		SANDERS	The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s.
0	776.0		SANDERS	Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.
0	777.0		SANDERS	The last point that I'd make.
0	778.0		SANDERS	I had a hearing.
0	779.0		SANDERS	I had all of the veterans groups in front of me.
0	780.0		SANDERS	And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?
0	781.0		SANDERS	Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good.
0	782.0		SANDERS	We've got to strengthen the V.A.
0	783.0		SANDERS	We do not privatize the V.A.
0	784.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	785.0		MADDOW	Thank you, Senator.
0	786.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, we're going to take another break.
0	787.0		MADDOW	We'll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.
0	788.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	789.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	790.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	791.0		TODD	And we are back.
0	792.0		TODD	We're gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.
0	793.0		TODD	Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday's Iowa caucuses -- narrowest of margins.
0	794.0		TODD	"Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, ""what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit."""
0	795.0		TODD	Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa?
0	796.0		TODD	And do you -- or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?
0	797.0		SANDERS	Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion.
0	798.0		SANDERS	This is not a -- this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.
0	799.0		SANDERS	I think where we now stand -- correct me if I'm wrong -- you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates.
0	800.0		SANDERS	We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.
0	801.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	802.0		SANDERS	You know, so this is not -- this is not the biggest deal in the world.
0	803.0		SANDERS	We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.
0	804.0		SANDERS	What the Des Moines Register said -- you know, there were coin -- I think there were half a dozen coin flips -- a fairly chaotic type situation.
0	805.0		SANDERS	At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.
0	806.0		SANDERS	And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa.
0	807.0		SANDERS	See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already.
0	808.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	809.0		SANDERS	And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but...
0	810.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	811.0		SANDERS	... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion.
0	812.0		SANDERS	But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.
0	813.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that's what the party wants to do?
0	814.0		TODD	You good with that?
0	815.0		CLINTON	Whatever they decide to do, that's fine.
0	816.0		TODD	That's fair enough.
0	817.0		TODD	OK.
0	818.0		CLINTON	All right.
0	819.0		TODD	Good, we move on.
0	820.0		TODD	We're happy with that.
0	821.0		TODD	We have more questions.
0	822.0		MADDOW	Senator -- Senator Sanders, in 1964...
0	823.0		SANDERS	Oh (inaudible).
0	824.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	825.0		SANDERS	See, when you are old, then they go back all these years.
0	826.0		SANDERS	All right.
0	827.0		SANDERS	What have you got?
0	828.0		MADDOW	In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement.
0	829.0		MADDOW	He was, however, far to the right of most of that party.
0	830.0		MADDOW	In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party's mainstream.
0	831.0		MADDOW	Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election.
0	832.0		MADDOW	Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election.
0	833.0		MADDOW	And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now.
0	834.0		MADDOW	We know that.
0	835.0		MADDOW	But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination?
0	836.0		SANDERS	Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process.
0	837.0		SANDERS	But let me just say this.
0	838.0		SANDERS	In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire.
0	839.0		SANDERS	For example, the last poll I saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one.
0	840.0		SANDERS	There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.
0	841.0		SANDERS	These are polls.
0	842.0		SANDERS	Polls go up.
0	843.0		SANDERS	Polls go down.
0	844.0		SANDERS	But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate.
1	845.0		SANDERS	Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.
1	846.0		SANDERS	Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression.
0	847.0		SANDERS	I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.
1	848.0		SANDERS	If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate.
0	849.0		SANDERS	We win governors' chairs up and down the line.
1	850.0		SANDERS	So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.
0	851.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	852.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House.
0	853.0		MADDOW	With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?
0	854.0		CLINTON	I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.
0	855.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	856.0		CLINTON	And I say that with great -- with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running.
0	857.0		CLINTON	I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign.
0	858.0		CLINTON	I hope that I will be able to earn their support.
0	859.0		CLINTON	They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.
0	860.0		CLINTON	But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election.
0	861.0		CLINTON	And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight.
0	862.0		CLINTON	I've been vetted.
0	863.0		CLINTON	There's hardly anything you don't know about me.
0	864.0		CLINTON	And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.
0	865.0		CLINTON	So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job.
0	866.0		CLINTON	I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans.
0	867.0		CLINTON	And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability.
0	868.0		CLINTON	It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.
0	869.0		CLINTON	And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to.
0	870.0		CLINTON	And that's what I'm prepared to...
0	871.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	872.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	873.0		TODD	We'll stay on this issue.
0	874.0		TODD	We'll stay on this topic.
0	875.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue, not because they don't believe your explanation, but because it's a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.
0	876.0		TODD	They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well.
0	877.0		TODD	So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee?
0	878.0		CLINTON	Absolutely I can.
0	879.0		CLINTON	You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that.
0	880.0		CLINTON	And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions.
0	881.0		CLINTON	They basically said yeah, didn't get her.
0	882.0		CLINTON	We tried.
0	883.0		CLINTON	That was all a political ploy.
0	884.0		CLINTON	Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts.
0	885.0		CLINTON	and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material.
0	886.0		CLINTON	They are retroactively classifying it.
0	887.0		CLINTON	I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity.
0	888.0		CLINTON	And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.
0	889.0		CLINTON	I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.
0	890.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	891.0		TODD	All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open -- there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material.
0	892.0		TODD	Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?
0	893.0		CLINTON	I am 100 percent confident.
0	894.0		CLINTON	This is a security review that was requested.
0	895.0		CLINTON	It is being carried out.
0	896.0		CLINTON	It will be resolved.
0	897.0		CLINTON	But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.
0	898.0		CLINTON	Honest to goodness, this is -- this just beggars the imagination.
0	899.0		CLINTON	So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.
0	900.0		TODD	Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).
0	901.0		SANDERS	(OFF-MIKE)
0	902.0		TODD	You're right.
0	903.0		TODD	I'm trying to -- it's a -- it's a family hour still right now.
0	904.0		TODD	After 11:00, I'll say it the other way.
0	905.0		TODD	And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy.
0	906.0		TODD	Are you -- how are you feeling about these darn emails now?
0	907.0		SANDERS	I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate.
0	908.0		SANDERS	There's a process under way.
0	909.0		SANDERS	I will not politicize it.
0	910.0		TODD	OK.
0	911.0		TODD	Senator Sanders, thank you.
0	912.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	913.0		SANDERS	And by the way -- and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.
0	914.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	915.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, thank you.
0	916.0		MADDOW	Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign.
0	917.0		MADDOW	You apologized for that when the incident was made public.
1	918.0		MADDOW	Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.
0	919.0		MADDOW	None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece.
0	920.0		MADDOW	Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?
0	921.0		SANDERS	Not losing control of our campaign.
0	922.0		SANDERS	You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.
1	923.0		SANDERS	In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper.
0	924.0		SANDERS	Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did.
1	925.0		SANDERS	So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not.
0	926.0		SANDERS	What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.
0	927.0		MADDOW	Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.
0	928.0		SANDERS	But that was only for -- that was not to be on television.
0	929.0		SANDERS	That's an important point.
1	930.0		SANDERS	That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.
0	931.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue?
0	932.0		CLINTON	No.
0	933.0		MADDOW	And with that, we will (inaudible).
0	934.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	935.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	936.0		MADDOW	Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates' debate.
0	937.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer.
0	938.0		MADDOW	It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.
0	939.0		MADDOW	The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide.
0	940.0		MADDOW	Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?
0	941.0		CLINTON	Yes, I do.
0	942.0		CLINTON	And -- you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.
0	943.0		CLINTON	I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism.
0	944.0		CLINTON	I have strong feelings about that.
0	945.0		CLINTON	I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.
0	946.0		CLINTON	I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it.
0	947.0		CLINTON	If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.
0	948.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...
0	949.0		SANDERS	... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are -- all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes.
0	950.0		SANDERS	It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.
0	951.0		SANDERS	Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty.
0	952.0		SANDERS	That's number one.
0	953.0		SANDERS	We have to be very careful about making sure about that.
0	954.0		SANDERS	But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there.
0	955.0		SANDERS	But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing.
0	956.0		SANDERS	So, when somebody commits...
0	957.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	958.0		SANDERS	... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key.
0	959.0		SANDERS	They're never going to get out.
0	960.0		SANDERS	But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing.
0	961.0		SANDERS	That's all.
0	962.0		SANDERS	(APPLAUSE)
0	963.0		MADDOW	Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states.
0	964.0		MADDOW	I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan.
0	965.0		MADDOW	On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it.
0	966.0		MADDOW	You have both been outspoken on that.
0	967.0		MADDOW	The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it.
0	968.0		MADDOW	There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today.
0	969.0		MADDOW	Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today.
0	970.0		MADDOW	If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?
0	971.0		CLINTON	Absolutely.
0	972.0		CLINTON	Absolutely.
0	973.0		CLINTON	You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before.
0	974.0		CLINTON	I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall.
0	975.0		CLINTON	I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.
0	976.0		CLINTON	This is an emergency.
0	977.0		CLINTON	Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life.
0	978.0		CLINTON	I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.
0	979.0		CLINTON	I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.
0	980.0		CLINTON	We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are bearing.
0	981.0		CLINTON	That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan.
0	982.0		CLINTON	If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.
0	983.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	984.0		MADDOW	Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing?
0	985.0		MADDOW	President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?
0	986.0		SANDERS	Absolutely.
0	987.0		SANDERS	I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.
0	988.0		SANDERS	You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day.
0	989.0		SANDERS	In fact, I think I never have in my life.
0	990.0		SANDERS	But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...
0	991.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	992.0		SANDERS	... was so outrageous.
0	993.0		SANDERS	What we are talking about are children being poisoned.
0	994.0		SANDERS	That's what we're talking about.
0	995.0		SANDERS	We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted.
0	996.0		SANDERS	We don't know how many thousands.
0	997.0		SANDERS	The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.
0	998.0		SANDERS	And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.
0	999.0		SANDERS	And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.
0	1000.0		SANDERS	Last point on this.
0	1001.0		SANDERS	And I suspect the secretary agrees.
0	1002.0		SANDERS	One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.
0	1003.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1004.0		SANDERS	Flint, Michigan, is a poor community.
0	1005.0		SANDERS	It is disproportionately African-American and minority.
0	1006.0		SANDERS	And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.
0	1007.0		MADDOW	Senator, thank you.
0	1008.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade.
1	1009.0		TODD	In the '90s you supported NAFTA.
1	1010.0		TODD	But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008.
1	1011.0		TODD	As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then -- which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.
0	1012.0		TODD	If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?
0	1013.0		CLINTON	You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator.
0	1014.0		CLINTON	And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.
0	1015.0		CLINTON	I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements.
0	1016.0		CLINTON	And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.
0	1017.0		CLINTON	I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.
1	1018.0		CLINTON	Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.
0	1019.0		CLINTON	Now I have a very clear view about this.
0	1020.0		CLINTON	We have to trade with the rest of the world.
0	1021.0		CLINTON	We are 5 percent of the world's population.
0	1022.0		CLINTON	We have to trade with the other 95 percent.
0	1023.0		CLINTON	And trade has to be reciprocal.
0	1024.0		CLINTON	That's the way the global economy works.
0	1025.0		CLINTON	But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.
0	1026.0		CLINTON	So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.
0	1027.0		CLINTON	I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.
0	1028.0		CLINTON	We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.
0	1029.0		CLINTON	So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.
0	1030.0		TODD	Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress.
0	1031.0		SANDERS	Absolutely right.
0	1032.0		TODD	But if you do that as president...
0	1033.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1034.0		TODD	If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?
0	1035.0		SANDERS	Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade.
0	1036.0		SANDERS	I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.
0	1037.0		SANDERS	I was not only in opposition to NAFTA -- and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.
0	1038.0		SANDERS	I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood -- I don't think this is really rocket science.
0	1039.0		SANDERS	We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.
1	1040.0		SANDERS	I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.
1	1041.0		SANDERS	I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.
0	1042.0		SANDERS	I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.
0	1043.0		SANDERS	So, do I believe in trade?
0	1044.0		SANDERS	Of course, I believe in trade.
1	1045.0		SANDERS	"But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay? We're going to China."""
1	1046.0		SANDERS	Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.
0	1047.0		SANDERS	Trade is one of the reasons for that.
0	1048.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1049.0		TODD	All right.
0	1050.0		TODD	Thank you both.
0	1051.0		TODD	We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing.
0	1052.0		TODD	We'll be right back.
0	1053.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1054.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	1055.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1056.0		TODD	All right.
0	1057.0		TODD	Welcome back here in the final minutes.
0	1058.0		MADDOW	The home stretch.
0	1059.0		TODD	The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.
0	1060.0		TODD	Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question.
0	1061.0		TODD	Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half.
0	1062.0		TODD	You're going to have to make choices.
0	1063.0		TODD	And there's a lot of heavy lifts.
0	1064.0		TODD	And he made choices.
0	1065.0		TODD	He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform.
0	1066.0		TODD	Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.
0	1067.0		TODD	So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change.
0	1068.0		TODD	What do you do first?
0	1069.0		TODD	Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.
0	1070.0		CLINTON	Well, I -- I don't accept that premise, Chuck.
0	1071.0		CLINTON	I think that we've got so much business we have to do.
0	1072.0		CLINTON	We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against -- we're against income inequality.
0	1073.0		CLINTON	We're against the abuses of powerful interests.
0	1074.0		CLINTON	We're against a lot of things.
0	1075.0		CLINTON	I'm for a lot of things.
0	1076.0		CLINTON	I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening.
0	1077.0		CLINTON	And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.
0	1078.0		CLINTON	I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.
0	1079.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1080.0		CLINTON	I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.
0	1081.0		CLINTON	I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.
0	1082.0		CLINTON	I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.
0	1083.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1084.0		CLINTON	Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses.
0	1085.0		CLINTON	I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces -- because that's the way Congress is set up.
0	1086.0		CLINTON	You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.
0	1087.0		CLINTON	Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure -- we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.
0	1088.0		TODD	All right, but Senator Sanders...
0	1089.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1090.0		TODD	... you've still got to do something first.
0	1091.0		TODD	As you know, history said -- shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.
0	1092.0		SANDERS	No, let...
0	1093.0		TODD	Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.
0	1094.0		SANDERS	I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.
0	1095.0		SANDERS	All right?
0	1096.0		SANDERS	We got to do that.
0	1097.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1098.0		SANDERS	But you miss -- when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important.
0	1099.0		SANDERS	And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.
0	1100.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1101.0		SANDERS	So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families.
0	1102.0		SANDERS	So let me be very clear.
0	1103.0		SANDERS	No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.
0	1104.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1105.0		SANDERS	Second point -- second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country -- largely African-American and Latino -- the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.
0	1106.0		SANDERS	No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell.
0	1107.0		SANDERS	"Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families."""
0	1108.0		SANDERS	And as president, that's what I will work hard on.
0	1109.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1110.0		TODD	OK.
0	1111.0		TODD	Thank you.
0	1112.0		MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government -- which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president.
0	1113.0		MADDOW	The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops -- is -- is there a department of government that you would get rid of?
0	1114.0		MADDOW	Or is there a whole new one that you would create?
0	1115.0		CLINTON	The answer to both of those is no.
0	1116.0		CLINTON	I'm interested in making what we have work better.
0	1117.0		CLINTON	I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.
0	1118.0		CLINTON	I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.
0	1119.0		CLINTON	I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.
0	1120.0		CLINTON	I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better -- better than anybody had run it in a long time.
0	1121.0		CLINTON	So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.
0	1122.0		CLINTON	"And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do."
0	1123.0		CLINTON	But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do.
0	1124.0		CLINTON	And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it.
0	1125.0		CLINTON	We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.
0	1126.0		CLINTON	But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry.
0	1127.0		CLINTON	So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows --
0	1128.0		MADDOW	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	1129.0		CLINTON	-- it will actually raise wages.
0	1130.0		CLINTON	You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.
0	1131.0		CLINTON	That's what I want to do.
0	1132.0		MADDOW	Thank you very much.
0	1133.0		MADDOW	Thank you.
0	1134.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1135.0		TODD	All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these.
0	1136.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see --
0	1137.0		CLINTON	I never said that.
0	1138.0		TODD	But do you see -- do you see a vice president?
0	1139.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1140.0		CLINTON	Look --
0	1141.0		TODD	Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?
0	1142.0		CLINTON	Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not -- I'm not getting ahead of myself.
0	1143.0		CLINTON	I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.
0	1144.0		CLINTON	If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.
0	1145.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1146.0		TODD	Senator, would you consider the secretary?
0	1147.0		SANDERS	I agree with what the secretary said.
0	1148.0		SANDERS	We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.
0	1149.0		SANDERS	And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand.
0	1150.0		SANDERS	I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual.
0	1151.0		SANDERS	And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.
0	1152.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1153.0		CLINTON	That's true.
0	1154.0		CLINTON	That's true.
0	1155.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1156.0		TODD	Secretary Clinton, closing statements.
0	1157.0		TODD	You are first.
0	1158.0		CLINTON	Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary.
0	1159.0		CLINTON	I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.
0	1160.0		CLINTON	You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities.
0	1161.0		CLINTON	Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.
0	1162.0		CLINTON	So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.
0	1163.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1164.0		TODD	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
0	1165.0		TODD	Senator Sanders.
0	1166.0		SANDERS	I -- my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.
0	1167.0		SANDERS	Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.
0	1168.0		SANDERS	I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money.
0	1169.0		SANDERS	But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
1	1170.0		SANDERS	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.
0	1171.0		SANDERS	We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.
0	1172.0		SANDERS	I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0	1173.0		SANDERS	I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0	1174.0		SANDERS	Thank you all.
0	1175.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1176.0		TODD	Well, there you have it.
0	1177.0		TODD	I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don't have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I don't think so.
0	1178.0		TODD	Our debate coverage -- (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).
0	1179.0		TODD	And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.
0	1180.0		MADDOW	We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire.
0	1181.0		MADDOW	You guys get to vote in just five days.
0	1182.0		MADDOW	I can't wait to see how it turns out.
0	1183.0		MADDOW	Don't screw up.
0	1184.0		TODD	We'll see you in a few minutes.
0	1185.0		TODD	Thank you.
0	1186.0		MADDOW	Thank you.
0	1187.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1.0		BLITZER	It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now.
0	2.0		BLITZER	You'll each have 30 seconds.
0	3.0		BLITZER	Dr. Carson, you're first.
0	4.0		CARSON	If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief.
0	5.0		CARSON	Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.
0	6.0		CARSON	Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other.
0	7.0		CARSON	What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight.
0	8.0		CARSON	It's not about us, it's about the American people.
0	9.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	10.0		BLITZER	Governor Kasich?
0	11.0		KASICH	Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English.
0	12.0		KASICH	And I'm standing on this stage.
0	13.0		KASICH	It's pretty remarkable.
0	14.0		KASICH	But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight.
0	15.0		KASICH	You can do whatever you want to do in your life.
0	16.0		KASICH	America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight.
0	17.0		KASICH	So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them.
0	18.0		KASICH	Shoot for the stars.
0	19.0		KASICH	America's great, and you can do it.
0	20.0		KASICH	Thank you, Wolf.
0	21.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	22.0		BLITZER	Senator Rubio?
0	23.0		RUBIO	Well, thank you.
0	24.0		RUBIO	This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 21st century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.
0	25.0		RUBIO	Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
0	26.0		RUBIO	Bush began the Reagan Revolution.
0	27.0		RUBIO	For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense.
0	28.0		RUBIO	But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams.
0	29.0		RUBIO	Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.
0	30.0		RUBIO	I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.
0	31.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	32.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz?
0	33.0		CRUZ	Welcome to Texas.
0	34.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	35.0		CRUZ	Here, Texas provided my family with hope.
0	36.0		CRUZ	Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college.
0	37.0		CRUZ	Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas.
0	38.0		CRUZ	I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here.
0	39.0		CRUZ	When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.
0	40.0		CRUZ	And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do.
0	41.0		CRUZ	And, as president, I will do the same.
0	42.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	43.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
0	44.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	45.0		TRUMP	My whole theme is make America great again.
0	46.0		TRUMP	We don't win anymore as a country.
0	47.0		TRUMP	We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military.
0	48.0		TRUMP	ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me.
0	49.0		TRUMP	We will.
0	50.0		TRUMP	We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.
0	51.0		TRUMP	We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.
0	52.0		TRUMP	We just don't win.
0	53.0		TRUMP	You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.
0	54.0		TRUMP	We're going to make a great country again.
0	55.0		TRUMP	We're going to start winning again.
0	56.0		TRUMP	We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me.
0	57.0		TRUMP	It's going to be a big difference.
0	58.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	59.0		BLITZER	Thank you very much.
0	60.0		BLITZER	It's now time to begin questions.
0	61.0		BLITZER	Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday.
0	62.0		BLITZER	When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.
0	63.0		BLITZER	Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo.
0	64.0		BLITZER	So, that's where we begin.
0	65.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.
0	66.0		BLITZER	"You've also promised to let what you call, ""the good ones"", come back in."
0	67.0		BLITZER	"Your words, ""the good ones"", after they've been deported."
0	68.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in.
0	69.0		BLITZER	He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you.
0	70.0		BLITZER	He calls your plan amnesty.
0	71.0		BLITZER	Is it?
0	72.0		TRUMP	First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.
0	73.0		TRUMP	As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.
0	74.0		TRUMP	It wouldn't even be a big subject.
0	75.0		TRUMP	But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country.
0	76.0		TRUMP	We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally.
0	77.0		TRUMP	They will go out.
0	78.0		TRUMP	They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process.
0	79.0		TRUMP	They have to come back legally.
0	80.0		TRUMP	They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.
0	81.0		TRUMP	They're going to get in line with other people.
0	82.0		TRUMP	The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.
0	83.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	84.0		BLITZER	"Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, ""the good ones"" come back to the United States?"
0	85.0		CRUZ	You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs.
0	86.0		CRUZ	Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.
0	87.0		CRUZ	You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona.
1	88.0		CRUZ	Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article.
0	89.0		CRUZ	Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing.
1	90.0		CRUZ	But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars.
0	91.0		CRUZ	And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise.
0	92.0		CRUZ	That's who we need to be fighting for.
0	93.0		CRUZ	Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.
0	94.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	95.0		CRUZ	Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that?
0	96.0		TRUMP	Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.
0	97.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	98.0		BLITZER	Senator Rubio?
0	99.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's.
0	100.0		BLITZER	He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.
0	101.0		BLITZER	Are those claims correct?
0	102.0		RUBIO	Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this.
0	103.0		RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.
0	104.0		RUBIO	And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays.
0	105.0		RUBIO	That's 45 percent of the problem right there.
0	106.0		RUBIO	It also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth.
0	107.0		RUBIO	And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else.
0	108.0		RUBIO	And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.
0	109.0		RUBIO	And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate.
0	110.0		RUBIO	Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.
0	111.0		RUBIO	In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship.
0	112.0		RUBIO	In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.
0	113.0		RUBIO	And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.
0	114.0		RUBIO	My mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.
0	115.0		RUBIO	So I think this is an important issue.
0	116.0		RUBIO	And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.
0	117.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0	118.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out.
0	119.0		TRUMP	If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.
0	120.0		TRUMP	Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.
0	121.0		TRUMP	As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help.
0	122.0		TRUMP	It's the up season.
0	123.0		TRUMP	People didn't want to have part-time jobs.
0	124.0		TRUMP	There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.
0	125.0		TRUMP	Everybody agrees with me on that.
0	126.0		TRUMP	They were part-time jobs.
0	127.0		TRUMP	You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.
0	128.0		RUBIO	That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.
0	129.0		RUBIO	You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.
0	130.0		RUBIO	And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.
0	131.0		TRUMP	I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.
0	132.0		TRUMP	He should have won that election.
0	133.0		TRUMP	He had a failed president.
0	134.0		TRUMP	He ran a terrible campaign.
0	135.0		TRUMP	He was a terrible candidate.
0	136.0		TRUMP	That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran...
0	137.0		RUBIO	No, he...
0	138.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	139.0		TRUMP	He ran one terrible campaign.
0	140.0		TRUMP	That's an election that should have been won.
0	141.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	142.0		RUBIO	"Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term ""self-deportation."""
0	143.0		RUBIO	I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.
0	144.0		RUBIO	But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point.
0	145.0		RUBIO	I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration.
0	146.0		RUBIO	This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.
1	147.0		RUBIO	But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.
1	148.0		RUBIO	You hired some workers from Poland...
0	149.0		TRUMP	No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.
0	150.0		TRUMP	You haven't hired anybody.
0	151.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	152.0		RUBIO	In fact, some of the people...
0	153.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	154.0		TRUMP	And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job.
0	155.0		TRUMP	You've hired nobody.
0	156.0		RUBIO	Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country...
0	157.0		TRUMP	You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.
0	158.0		TRUMP	So don't tell me about that.
0	159.0		RUBIO	Let me just say -- let me finish the statement.
0	160.0		RUBIO	This is important.
0	161.0		TRUMP	You haven't hired one person, you liar.
1	162.0		RUBIO	He hired workers from Poland.
1	163.0		RUBIO	And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...
1	164.0		TRUMP	That's wrong.
1	165.0		TRUMP	That's wrong.
1	166.0		TRUMP	Totally wrong.
1	167.0		RUBIO	That's a fact.
0	168.0		RUBIO	People can look it up.
0	169.0		RUBIO	I'm sure people are Googling it right now.
0	170.0		RUBIO	Look it up.
1	171.0		RUBIO	Trump Polish workers, you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects.
1	172.0		RUBIO	He did it.
0	173.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	174.0		RUBIO	That happened.
0	175.0		TRUMP	I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0	176.0		TRUMP	Tens of thousands...
0	177.0		RUBIO	Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.
0	178.0		TRUMP	Be quiet.
0	179.0		TRUMP	Just be quiet.
0	180.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	181.0		TRUMP	Let me talk.
0	182.0		TRUMP	I've hired tens of thousands of people.
0	183.0		TRUMP	He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well.
0	184.0		TRUMP	Everybody was happy.
1	185.0		RUBIO	You paid a million dollars.
0	186.0		TRUMP	And by the way, the laws were totally different.
0	187.0		TRUMP	That was a whole different world.
0	188.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	189.0		TRUMP	But I've hired people.
0	190.0		TRUMP	Nobody up here has hired anybody.
0	191.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	192.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States.
0	193.0		BLITZER	What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?
0	194.0		CRUZ	Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally.
0	195.0		CRUZ	U.S. citizens can come back.
0	196.0		CRUZ	That's existing law.
0	197.0		CRUZ	But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration.
0	198.0		CRUZ	I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall.
0	199.0		CRUZ	"And in 2013, when I was fight against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill, where was Donald?"
0	200.0		CRUZ	"He was firing Dennis Rodman on ""Celebrity Apprentice."""
0	201.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	202.0		CRUZ	"And indeed, if you look at the ""gang of eight,"" one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill."
1	203.0		CRUZ	If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans.
0	204.0		CRUZ	And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.
0	205.0		CRUZ	And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty.
0	206.0		CRUZ	And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record.
1	207.0		CRUZ	And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.
0	208.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	209.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0	210.0		TRUMP	I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years.
0	211.0		TRUMP	And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.
0	212.0		TRUMP	I've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman.
0	213.0		TRUMP	As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody.
0	214.0		TRUMP	I got along with everybody.
0	215.0		TRUMP	You get along with nobody.
0	216.0		TRUMP	You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time.
0	217.0		TRUMP	These are minor details.
0	218.0		TRUMP	But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one.
0	219.0		TRUMP	You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people.
0	220.0		TRUMP	You should be ashamed of yourself.
0	221.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	222.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz?
0	223.0		CRUZ	You know, I actually think Donald is right.
0	224.0		CRUZ	He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington.
0	225.0		CRUZ	And he's right.
0	226.0		CRUZ	He has supported -- he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats.
0	227.0		CRUZ	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants.
0	228.0		CRUZ	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight.
0	229.0		CRUZ	And, you know, he is right.
0	230.0		CRUZ	When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.
0	231.0		CRUZ	And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president.
0	232.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	233.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	234.0		TRUMP	Here's a man -- Robin Hood.
0	235.0		TRUMP	This is Robin Hood over here.
0	236.0		TRUMP	He talks about corruption.
0	237.0		TRUMP	On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation.
0	238.0		TRUMP	He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest.
0	239.0		TRUMP	He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.
0	240.0		TRUMP	Give me a break.
0	241.0		BLITZER	All right.
0	242.0		BLITZER	We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.
0	243.0		BLITZER	Governor Kasich...
0	244.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	245.0		CRUZ	Wolf, can I respond to that attack?
0	246.0		BLITZER	You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in.
0	247.0		BLITZER	He's been waiting patiently.
0	248.0		BLITZER	"Governor Kasich, the idea -- you've said this, and I want to quote you now ""The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it."""
0	249.0		BLITZER	Those are your words.
0	250.0		BLITZER	Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?
0	251.0		KASICH	Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States.
0	252.0		KASICH	He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization.
0	253.0		KASICH	You see, that was a time when things worked.
0	254.0		KASICH	It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.
0	255.0		KASICH	Look, I think there is an answer here.
0	256.0		KASICH	The answer is you complete the border.
0	257.0		KASICH	You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in.
0	258.0		KASICH	If you come in, we don't want any excuse.
0	259.0		KASICH	You're going to go back.
0	260.0		KASICH	But I favor a guest worker program.
0	261.0		KASICH	I think it's practical.
0	262.0		KASICH	And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service.
0	263.0		KASICH	And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship.
0	264.0		KASICH	I don't think we're going to tear families apart.
0	265.0		KASICH	I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes.
0	266.0		KASICH	I don't think -- first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.
0	267.0		KASICH	You know what happened?
0	268.0		KASICH	The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border.
0	269.0		KASICH	And I think it was probably business interests that affected it.
0	270.0		KASICH	But at the end of the day, let's be practical.
0	271.0		KASICH	Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs.
0	272.0		KASICH	With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again.
0	273.0		KASICH	And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.
0	274.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	275.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Governor.
0	276.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	277.0		BLITZER	Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation.
0	278.0		BLITZER	You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party.
0	279.0		BLITZER	Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?
0	280.0		CARSON	I believe in liberty and justice for all.
0	281.0		CARSON	I think everything that we do should be fair.
0	282.0		CARSON	And I've already described -- you know, how we can secure the border.
0	283.0		CARSON	We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily.
0	284.0		CARSON	And we have to stop that.
0	285.0		CARSON	But in terms of the people who are here already, after we -- after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable.
0	286.0		CARSON	And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.
0	287.0		CARSON	They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore.
0	288.0		CARSON	And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.
0	289.0		CARSON	If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through.
0	290.0		CARSON	I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.
0	291.0		CARSON	 And we have other ways of -- of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here.
0	292.0		CARSON	That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.
0	293.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
0	294.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	295.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.
0	296.0		TRUMP	(inaudible).
0	297.0		BLITZER	It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now.
0	298.0		BLITZER	You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.
0	299.0		TRUMP	Correct.
0	300.0		BLITZER	The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen.
0	301.0		BLITZER	The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.
0	302.0		BLITZER	"In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox -- he said today, and I'm quoting him -- he said, ""I'm not going to pay for that,"" quote, ""effing wall."""
0	303.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	304.0		BLITZER	So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?
0	305.0		TRUMP	I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.
0	306.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	307.0		TRUMP	It just got 10 feet taller.
0	308.0		TRUMP	I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement.
0	309.0		TRUMP	I saw him use the word that he used.
0	310.0		TRUMP	I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.
0	311.0		TRUMP	This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK?
0	312.0		TRUMP	Number one.
0	313.0		TRUMP	Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year.
0	314.0		TRUMP	And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.
0	315.0		TRUMP	We're going to make them pay for that wall.
0	316.0		TRUMP	Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it.
0	317.0		TRUMP	If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.
0	318.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	319.0		TRUMP	But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion.
0	320.0		TRUMP	You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles.
0	321.0		TRUMP	The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles.
0	322.0		TRUMP	We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.
0	323.0		TRUMP	We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall.
0	324.0		TRUMP	This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at.
0	325.0		TRUMP	This is a wall that's going to work.
0	326.0		TRUMP	Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors.
0	327.0		TRUMP	They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...
0	328.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	329.0		TRUMP	... immediately.
0	330.0		TRUMP	Mexico will pay for the wall.
0	331.0		TRUMP	It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.
0	332.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	333.0		BLITZER	If the -- if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?
0	334.0		TRUMP	Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth.
0	335.0		TRUMP	We're losing so much.
0	336.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	337.0		TRUMP	We're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China, we're losing $500 billion a year.
0	338.0		TRUMP	"And then people say, ""don't we want to trade?"""
0	339.0		TRUMP	I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion.
0	340.0		TRUMP	I don't want to lose $58 billion.
0	341.0		TRUMP	Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners.
0	342.0		TRUMP	They just took Ford.
0	343.0		TRUMP	They're building a $2.5 billion plant.
0	344.0		TRUMP	They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.
0	345.0		TRUMP	And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way.
0	346.0		TRUMP	But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico.
0	347.0		TRUMP	They're taking our businesses.
0	348.0		TRUMP	I don't mind.
0	349.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	350.0		BLITZER	Senator Rubio?
0	351.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	352.0		RUBIO	Yeah, a couple points.
0	353.0		RUBIO	If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.
0	354.0		RUBIO	The second...
0	355.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	356.0		TRUMP	Such a cute sound bite.
0	357.0		RUBIO	But it -- no, it's not a sound bite.
0	358.0		RUBIO	It's a fact.
0	359.0		RUBIO	Again, go online and Google it.
0	360.0		RUBIO	Donald Trump, Polish workers.
0	361.0		RUBIO	You'll see it.
0	362.0		RUBIO	The second thing, about the trade war -- I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China.
0	363.0		RUBIO	So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.
0	364.0		TRUMP	All right, you know what?
0	365.0		RUBIO	Why don't you make them in America?
0	366.0		TRUMP	Because they devalue their currency -- they devalue their currencies...
0	367.0		RUBIO	Well, then make them in America.
0	368.0		TRUMP	... that makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business.
0	369.0		TRUMP	You lose on everything...
0	370.0		RUBIO	Well, make them in America.
0	371.0		TRUMP	Let me just tell you -- they de-value their currency.
0	372.0		TRUMP	They de-value their currencies.
0	373.0		RUBIO	Well then, make them in America.
0	374.0		TRUMP	That makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business.
0	375.0		TRUMP	You lose on everything you do.
0	376.0		RUBIO	Well, make them in America.
0	377.0		TRUMP	Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies.
0	378.0		TRUMP	China, Mexico, everybody.
0	379.0		TRUMP	Japan with the cars.
0	380.0		TRUMP	They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...
0	381.0		RUBIO	And so you make them in China and in Russia.
0	382.0		TRUMP	But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.
0	383.0		RUBIO	Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies.
0	384.0		RUBIO	You've bankrupted..
0	385.0		TRUMP	No, I -- and you know why?
0	386.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	387.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	388.0		RUBIO	I don't know anything about...
0	389.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	390.0		RUBIO	... starting a university, and that was a fake university.
0	391.0		BLITZER	One at a time.
0	392.0		TRUMP	First of all...
0	393.0		BLITZER	One at a time.
0	394.0		TRUMP	... first of all, that's called a...
0	395.0		RUBIO	There are people who borrowed $36,000...
0	396.0		BLITZER	Hold on.
0	397.0		BLITZER	One at a time, Mr. Trump.
0	398.0		RUBIO	... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now -- $36,000 to go to a university...
0	399.0		TRUMP	And by the way -- and by the way...
0	400.0		RUBIO	... that's a fake school.
0	401.0		TRUMP	... and by the way...
0	402.0		RUBIO	And you know what they got?
0	403.0		RUBIO	They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...
0	404.0		TRUMP	I've won most of the lawsuits.
0	405.0		RUBIO	That's what they got for $36,000.
0	406.0		BLITZER	All right, I want to move on.
0	407.0		TRUMP	And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.
0	408.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...
0	409.0		RUBIO	Most of the lawsuits.
0	410.0		BLITZER	I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.
0	411.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	412.0		TRUMP	Hey Wolf, let me ask you.
0	413.0		TRUMP	Am I allowed to respond to this?
0	414.0		BLITZER	You're allowed -- you've been responding.
0	415.0		TRUMP	OK. Well let -- no, I haven't.
0	416.0		TRUMP	I really haven't.
0	417.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	418.0		RUBIO	He's talked through the whole thing.
0	419.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	420.0		TRUMP	Here's a guy -- here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed.
0	421.0		TRUMP	You tell me about this guy.
0	422.0		TRUMP	This is what we're going to have as president.
0	423.0		RUBIO	Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.
0	424.0		RUBIO	If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?
0	425.0		TRUMP	No, no, no.
0	426.0		RUBIO	Selling watches in (inaudible)
0	427.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	428.0		TRUMP	(Inaudible) I took...
0	429.0		RUBIO	That's where he would be.
0	430.0		TRUMP	That is so wrong.
0	431.0		TRUMP	We'll work on that.
0	432.0		TRUMP	I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.
0	433.0		RUBIO	Oh, OK. One million.
0	434.0		TRUMP	I borrowed $1 million...
0	435.0		RUBIO	Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.
0	436.0		TRUMP	I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...
0	437.0		RUBIO	Oh, he doesn't make that money.
0	438.0		TRUMP	... more than $10 billion.
0	439.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	440.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	441.0		BLITZER	I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo.
0	442.0		BLITZER	Maria?
0	443.0		CELESTE	Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.
0	444.0		RUBIO	Correct.
0	445.0		CELESTE	It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants.
0	446.0		CELESTE	This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.
0	447.0		CELESTE	So Senator Rubio, what changed?
0	448.0		RUBIO	It didn't change.
0	449.0		CELESTE	Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?
0	450.0		RUBIO	No, it's the same policy.
0	451.0		RUBIO	It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order.
0	452.0		RUBIO	The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it.
0	453.0		RUBIO	And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old.
0	454.0		RUBIO	I understand.
0	455.0		RUBIO	I know people that are personally impacted by this.
0	456.0		RUBIO	The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional.
0	457.0		RUBIO	The president doesn't have the power to do that.
0	458.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	459.0		RUBIO	And he himself admitted that.
0	460.0		CELESTE	Senator, Senator...
0	461.0		RUBIO	I'm sorry, but let me finish my...
0	462.0		CELESTE	... but you went -- you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.
0	463.0		RUBIO	No, but this is not about deportation.
0	464.0		RUBIO	Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation.
0	465.0		RUBIO	This is about DACA.
0	466.0		RUBIO	DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.
0	467.0		RUBIO	I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.
0	468.0		RUBIO	Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional.
0	469.0		RUBIO	No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.
0	470.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	471.0		CELESTE	Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English.
0	472.0		CELESTE	So in what sense did he lie?
0	473.0		RUBIO	Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA.
0	474.0		RUBIO	I am going to get rid of DACA.
0	475.0		RUBIO	In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point.
0	476.0		RUBIO	That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it.
0	477.0		RUBIO	And new people will not be able to apply.
0	478.0		RUBIO	In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.
0	479.0		RUBIO	That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away.
0	480.0		RUBIO	But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take -- as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.
0	481.0		TRUMP	I have to say, he lied this time.
0	482.0		TRUMP	He lied.
0	483.0		TRUMP	100 percent.
0	484.0		TRUMP	100 percent.
0	485.0		RUBIO	You lied about the Polish workers.
0	486.0		TRUMP	Yes, yes, yes.
0	487.0		TRUMP	38 years ago.
0	488.0		RUBIO	You lied to the students at Trump University.
0	489.0		CELESTE	Let Senator Cruz jump in.
0	490.0		RUBIO	Oh, he lied 38 years ago.
0	491.0		RUBIO	All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.
0	492.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	493.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	494.0		CRUZ	Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that.
0	495.0		CRUZ	You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program.
0	496.0		CRUZ	Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.
0	497.0		CRUZ	That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.
0	498.0		CRUZ	You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies.
0	499.0		CRUZ	When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.
0	500.0		CRUZ	Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty.
0	501.0		CRUZ	Well, someday it should end, just not now.
0	502.0		CRUZ	And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.
0	503.0		RUBIO	That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.
0	504.0		RUBIO	What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now.
0	505.0		RUBIO	By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away.
0	506.0		RUBIO	I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.
0	507.0		RUBIO	And, again, you read the statement in Spanish.
0	508.0		RUBIO	I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president.
0	509.0		RUBIO	I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it.
0	510.0		RUBIO	New applicants will not be able to apply.
0	511.0		RUBIO	That is the end of DACA.
0	512.0		RUBIO	I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.
0	513.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	514.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	515.0		CELESTE	Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage.
0	516.0		CELESTE	As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.
0	517.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	518.0		CELESTE	And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other.
0	519.0		CELESTE	Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.
0	520.0		CELESTE	So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?
0	521.0		CRUZ	Well, Maria, you are right.
0	522.0		CRUZ	It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.
0	523.0		CRUZ	It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.
0	524.0		CRUZ	You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal.
0	525.0		CRUZ	That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.
0	526.0		CRUZ	At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide.
0	527.0		CRUZ	And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community.
0	528.0		CRUZ	The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.
0	529.0		CRUZ	You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country.
0	530.0		CRUZ	And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story.
0	531.0		CRUZ	Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream.
0	532.0		CRUZ	And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community.
0	533.0		CRUZ	It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...
0	534.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)
0	535.0		CRUZ	... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.
0	536.0		RUBIO	I'm sorry I was mentioned...
0	537.0		CELESTE	Governor Kasich.
0	538.0		RUBIO	Maria I was mentioned in that.
0	539.0		RUBIO	I was mentioned in that statement.
0	540.0		CELESTE	Governor Kasich, after the...
0	541.0		RUBIO	... OK.
0	542.0		RUBIO	I was mentioned -- just because of the hispanic -- and I'll be brief.
0	543.0		RUBIO	A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American.
0	544.0		RUBIO	We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.
0	545.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	546.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	547.0		RUBIO	And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.
0	548.0		RUBIO	Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it.
0	549.0		RUBIO	But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...
0	550.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)
0	551.0		RUBIO	... and, you can only do that through free enterprise.
0	552.0		RUBIO	That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.
0	553.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	554.0		CELESTE	Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos.
0	555.0		CELESTE	"Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, ""if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."""
0	556.0		CELESTE	So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?
0	557.0		KASICH	Well, I'm not going to talk about that.
0	558.0		KASICH	I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates.
0	559.0		KASICH	My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.
0	560.0		KASICH	I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think.
0	561.0		KASICH	I'm going to tell you what I think.
0	562.0		KASICH	My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning.
0	563.0		KASICH	I haven't changed anything with it.
0	564.0		KASICH	And, look, my view is, we need economic growth.
0	565.0		KASICH	Everything starts with economic growth.
0	566.0		KASICH	And how do you get it?
0	567.0		KASICH	Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.
0	568.0		KASICH	That gives you economic growth.
0	569.0		KASICH	I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.
0	570.0		KASICH	But here's the thing that I believe.
0	571.0		KASICH	Economic growth is not an end unto itself.
0	572.0		KASICH	We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.
0	573.0		KASICH	Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.
0	574.0		KASICH	It's what Jack Kemp used to say.
0	575.0		KASICH	A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats.
0	576.0		KASICH	And you know what?
0	577.0		KASICH	With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me.
0	578.0		KASICH	And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.
0	579.0		KASICH	It's time to solve problems.
0	580.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	581.0		CELESTE	Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?
0	582.0		CARSON	I didn't hear the first part of the question?
0	583.0		CELESTE	The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.
0	584.0		CELESTE	And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.
0	585.0		CARSON	OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.
0	586.0		CARSON	And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group.
0	587.0		CARSON	You know, this is America.
0	588.0		CARSON	And we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people.
0	589.0		CARSON	And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that.
0	590.0		CARSON	And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks.
0	591.0		CARSON	We don't pick and choose winners and losers.
0	592.0		CARSON	We are compassionate.
0	593.0		CARSON	But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.
0	594.0		CARSON	When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.
0	595.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	596.0		CELESTE	Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race.
0	597.0		CELESTE	You keep saying that Hispanics love you.
0	598.0		TRUMP	True.
0	599.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	600.0		CELESTE	And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.
0	601.0		TRUMP	True.
0	602.0		CELESTE	But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you.
0	603.0		CELESTE	They don't like you.
0	604.0		CELESTE	Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...
0	605.0		TRUMP	No.
0	606.0		CELESTE	... candidate in a general election?
0	607.0		TRUMP	First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.
0	608.0		CELESTE	You used to say that you love...
0	609.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	610.0		TRUMP	Number one.
0	611.0		TRUMP	Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics.
0	612.0		TRUMP	They're incredible people.
0	613.0		TRUMP	They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.
0	614.0		TRUMP	I won with every single category.
0	615.0		TRUMP	I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics.
0	616.0		TRUMP	And I got 46 percent.
0	617.0		TRUMP	Nobody else was close.
0	618.0		TRUMP	Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.
0	619.0		TRUMP	They get it.
0	620.0		TRUMP	They're incredible people.
0	621.0		TRUMP	They're incredible workers.
0	622.0		TRUMP	They get it.
0	623.0		TRUMP	And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics.
0	624.0		TRUMP	I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.
0	625.0		TRUMP	But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting -- bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.
0	626.0		TRUMP	And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in.
0	627.0		TRUMP	We're getting record-setting numbers.
0	628.0		TRUMP	I think I have something to do with that.
0	629.0		TRUMP	We're getting record-setting numbers.
0	630.0		TRUMP	And I won every one -- the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.
0	631.0		TRUMP	New people are coming into the Republican Party.
0	632.0		TRUMP	We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.
0	633.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	634.0		CELESTE	For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past.
0	635.0		CELESTE	But it is not just a Telemundo poll.
0	636.0		CELESTE	We have...
0	637.0		TRUMP	I love them.
0	638.0		TRUMP	I love them.
0	639.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	640.0		CELESTE	All right.
0	641.0		CELESTE	Well, it's not the only poll.
0	642.0		TRUMP	They're fine.
0	643.0		TRUMP	Do you know what?
0	644.0		TRUMP	They're fine.
0	645.0		CELESTE	Just last night -- let me -- let me finish, please.
0	646.0		CELESTE	Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you.
0	647.0		CELESTE	And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 -- let me finish please -- of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.
0	648.0		TRUMP	Why did they take the poll?
0	649.0		TRUMP	Why did they...
0	650.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	651.0		CELESTE	I am making reference -- I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.
0	652.0		TRUMP	I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics.
0	653.0		TRUMP	And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision.
0	654.0		TRUMP	It was settled.
0	655.0		TRUMP	We're good friends now.
0	656.0		TRUMP	It was all settled up.
0	657.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	658.0		TRUMP	Very happy, very happy.
0	659.0		TRUMP	Very good people.
0	660.0		TRUMP	I'm just telling you -- I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics.
0	661.0		TRUMP	I will do better than anybody on this stage.
0	662.0		TRUMP	I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics.
0	663.0		TRUMP	But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.
0	664.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump, thank you.
0	665.0		BLITZER	I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue.
0	666.0		BLITZER	I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.
0	667.0		BLITZER	Hugh?
0	668.0		HEWITT	Thank you, Wolf.
0	669.0		HEWITT	To me, it's the most important issue.
0	670.0		HEWITT	I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.
0	671.0		HEWITT	Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?
0	672.0		CRUZ	Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it -- Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election.
0	673.0		CRUZ	Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend.
0	674.0		CRUZ	And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance.
0	675.0		CRUZ	We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.
0	676.0		CRUZ	Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage.
0	677.0		CRUZ	In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists.
0	678.0		CRUZ	So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.
0	679.0		CRUZ	But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000.
0	680.0		CRUZ	Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want.
0	681.0		CRUZ	Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.
0	682.0		CRUZ	"I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question ""Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court?"""
0	683.0		CRUZ	I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.
0	684.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	685.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty.
0	686.0		HEWITT	Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills.
0	687.0		HEWITT	They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.
0	688.0		HEWITT	Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?
0	689.0		TRUMP	Yes, I would.
0	690.0		TRUMP	And I've been there.
0	691.0		TRUMP	And I've been there very strongly.
0	692.0		TRUMP	I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault.
0	693.0		TRUMP	It's not Ted's fault.
0	694.0		TRUMP	Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted.
0	695.0		TRUMP	Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare.
0	696.0		TRUMP	Might as well be called Roberts-care.
0	697.0		TRUMP	Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve.
0	698.0		TRUMP	And we ended up with Obamacare.
0	699.0		TRUMP	That is a rough thing.
0	700.0		TRUMP	And I know Ted feels badly about it.
0	701.0		TRUMP	And I think he probably still respects the judge.
0	702.0		TRUMP	But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.
0	703.0		TRUMP	Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen.
0	704.0		TRUMP	But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.
0	705.0		HEWITT	Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?
0	706.0		CRUZ	Well, listen -- Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts.
0	707.0		CRUZ	Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.
0	708.0		CRUZ	But I would not have nominated John Roberts.
0	709.0		CRUZ	I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals.
0	710.0		CRUZ	And I'll tell you, Hugh...
0	711.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	712.0		CRUZ	... you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who -- who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.
0	713.0		CRUZ	Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.
0	714.0		CRUZ	And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...
0	715.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	716.0		CRUZ	... and cut a deal.
0	717.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump...
0	718.0		CRUZ	So that means on Supreme Court...
0	719.0		HEWITT	... can I...
0	720.0		CRUZ	... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.
0	721.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	722.0		HEWITT	Can I trust you on religious liberty?
0	723.0		TRUMP	Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this.
0	724.0		TRUMP	Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.
0	725.0		TRUMP	I watched the other senators laughing and smiling.
0	726.0		TRUMP	And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work.
0	727.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	728.0		TRUMP	We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.
0	729.0		TRUMP	It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that.
0	730.0		TRUMP	Now, Ted's been very critical -- I have a sister who's a brilliant...
0	731.0		HEWITT	Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?
0	732.0		TRUMP	... excuse me.
0	733.0		TRUMP	She's a brilliant judge.
0	734.0		TRUMP	He's been criticizing -- he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill.
0	735.0		TRUMP	You know who else signed that bill?
0	736.0		TRUMP	Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.
0	737.0		TRUMP	So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted.
0	738.0		TRUMP	What do you think?
0	739.0		HEWITT	Let me -- Senator.
0	740.0		CRUZ	Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution.
0	741.0		CRUZ	I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.
0	742.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	743.0		CRUZ	And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it.
0	744.0		CRUZ	You've got to be willing to cut a deal.
1	745.0		CRUZ	And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald -- Donald Trump.
0	746.0		CRUZ	Why?
1	747.0		CRUZ	Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.
0	748.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	749.0		CRUZ	You know what, Donald...
0	750.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	751.0		HEWITT	Senator Rubio.
0	752.0		CRUZ	I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.
0	753.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	754.0		TRUMP	When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you?
0	755.0		TRUMP	Crazy zealot -- give me a break.
0	756.0		HEWITT	Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty.
0	757.0		HEWITT	You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera.
0	758.0		HEWITT	Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?
0	759.0		RUBIO	Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.
0	760.0		RUBIO	Justice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.
0	761.0		RUBIO	And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.
0	762.0		RUBIO	So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would.
0	763.0		RUBIO	But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.
0	764.0		RUBIO	Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement.
0	765.0		RUBIO	"But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, ""I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."""
0	766.0		RUBIO	In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood.
0	767.0		RUBIO	He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel.
0	768.0		RUBIO	These are concerning things.
0	769.0		RUBIO	And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.
0	770.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump?
0	771.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	772.0		TRUMP	Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia.
0	773.0		TRUMP	I thought he was terrific.
0	774.0		TRUMP	And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat.
0	775.0		TRUMP	Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president.
0	776.0		TRUMP	A great president.
0	777.0		TRUMP	As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life.
0	778.0		TRUMP	I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.
0	779.0		TRUMP	But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood.
0	780.0		TRUMP	So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.
0	781.0		TRUMP	And I wouldn't fund it.
0	782.0		TRUMP	I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent.
0	783.0		TRUMP	I don't know what percentage it is.
0	784.0		TRUMP	They say it's 3 percent.
0	785.0		TRUMP	But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life.
0	786.0		TRUMP	But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.
0	787.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	788.0		HEWITT	Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty.
0	789.0		HEWITT	You've been a little bit less emphatic.
0	790.0		HEWITT	You've said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake.
0	791.0		HEWITT	Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people?
0	792.0		KASICH	Well, you know, of course.
0	793.0		KASICH	I mean, if -- look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church.
0	794.0		KASICH	Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in.
0	795.0		KASICH	No question and no doubt about it.
0	796.0		KASICH	Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it.
0	797.0		KASICH	I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on.
0	798.0		KASICH	And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?
0	799.0		KASICH	If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.
0	800.0		KASICH	I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce.
0	801.0		KASICH	That's my view.
0	802.0		KASICH	And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.
0	803.0		KASICH	But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions.
0	804.0		KASICH	And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor.
0	805.0		KASICH	I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.
0	806.0		KASICH	And you know what they are?
0	807.0		KASICH	They're conservatives.
0	808.0		KASICH	Go check it out.
0	809.0		KASICH	They are conservatives.
0	810.0		KASICH	They don't make the law.
0	811.0		KASICH	They interpret the law.
0	812.0		KASICH	That's all they do.
0	813.0		KASICH	And they stick by the Constitution.
0	814.0		KASICH	So I will do that.
0	815.0		KASICH	But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that.
0	816.0		KASICH	I think my position is clear.
0	817.0		HEWITT	Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you.
0	818.0		HEWITT	Are their positions clear?
0	819.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	820.0		HEWITT	Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?
0	821.0		CARSON	Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia.
0	822.0		CARSON	I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.
0	823.0		CARSON	A tremendous wit and intellect.
0	824.0		CARSON	As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights.
0	825.0		CARSON	And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.
0	826.0		CARSON	But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights.
0	827.0		CARSON	So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it.
0	828.0		CARSON	That's unfair.
0	829.0		CARSON	And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done.
0	830.0		CARSON	That's why we have divided government.
0	831.0		CARSON	And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.
0	832.0		CARSON	And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been.
0	833.0		CARSON	What have they done in the past?
0	834.0		CARSON	What kind of judgments have they made?
0	835.0		CARSON	What kind of associations do they have?
0	836.0		CARSON	That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.
0	837.0		CARSON	The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.
0	838.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
0	839.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	840.0		BLITZER	All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it.
0	841.0		BLITZER	I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.
0	842.0		BASH	Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good.
0	843.0		BASH	So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare.
0	844.0		BASH	Are you saying that you're worried he won't?
0	845.0		RUBIO	The individual mandate.
0	846.0		RUBIO	He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it.
0	847.0		RUBIO	That should not remain there.
0	848.0		RUBIO	I think here's what we need to replace it with.
0	849.0		RUBIO	We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again.
0	850.0		RUBIO	If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.
0	851.0		RUBIO	Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.
0	852.0		RUBIO	And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage.
0	853.0		RUBIO	And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy.
0	854.0		RUBIO	It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time.
0	855.0		RUBIO	It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law.
0	856.0		RUBIO	And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.
0	857.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	858.0		BASH	Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate.
0	859.0		BASH	Would you respond?
0	860.0		TRUMP	I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare.
0	861.0		TRUMP	We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.
0	862.0		TRUMP	I think we need it.
0	863.0		TRUMP	I think it's a modern age.
0	864.0		TRUMP	And I think we have to have it.
0	865.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	866.0		BASH	OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions.
0	867.0		BASH	What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance.
0	868.0		BASH	Are they wrong?
0	869.0		TRUMP	I think they're wrong 100 percent.
0	870.0		TRUMP	What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians.
0	871.0		TRUMP	The insurance companies get what they want.
0	872.0		TRUMP	We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.
0	873.0		TRUMP	We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.
0	874.0		TRUMP	The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests.
0	875.0		TRUMP	They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.
0	876.0		TRUMP	And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?
0	877.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	878.0		TRUMP	Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.
0	879.0		TRUMP	But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.
0	880.0		TRUMP	The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.
1	881.0		TRUMP	I'm self-funding my campaign.
1	882.0		TRUMP	I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign.
0	883.0		TRUMP	I'm going to do what's right.
0	884.0		TRUMP	We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.
0	885.0		BASH	But, Mr. Trump...
0	886.0		TRUMP	... And, you're going to see -- excuse me.
0	887.0		TRUMP	You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay.
0	888.0		TRUMP	Right now they're making a fortune.
0	889.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	890.0		BASH	But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...
0	891.0		TRUMP	That's going to solve the problem.
0	892.0		TRUMP	And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it.
0	893.0		TRUMP	They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.
0	894.0		TRUMP	I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine.
0	895.0		TRUMP	The top guys, they're friends of mine.
0	896.0		TRUMP	I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest.
0	897.0		TRUMP	They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.
0	898.0		TRUMP	One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling.
0	899.0		TRUMP	He's not laughing so much anymore.
0	900.0		TRUMP	Hi.
0	901.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	902.0		TRUMP	Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune.
0	903.0		TRUMP	Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing.
0	904.0		TRUMP	Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans.
0	905.0		TRUMP	But, we should keep preexisting conditions.
0	906.0		RUBIO	Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...
0	907.0		BASH	... Go ahead.
0	908.0		RUBIO	You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened.
0	909.0		RUBIO	When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.
0	910.0		RUBIO	All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.
0	911.0		RUBIO	And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.
0	912.0		RUBIO	The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that.
0	913.0		RUBIO	They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.
0	914.0		RUBIO	Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing.
0	915.0		RUBIO	What is your plan?
0	916.0		RUBIO	I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means.
0	917.0		RUBIO	This is not a game where you draw maps...
0	918.0		TRUMP	... And, you don't know what it means...
0	919.0		RUBIO	... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?
0	920.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	921.0		RUBIO	What is your plan on healthcare?
0	922.0		TRUMP	You don't know.
0	923.0		BASH	(inaudible)
0	924.0		TRUMP	The biggest problem...
0	925.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	926.0		RUBIO	... What's your plan...
0	927.0		TRUMP	The biggest problem, I'll have you know...
0	928.0		RUBIO	... What's your plan...
0	929.0		TRUMP	... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie.
0	930.0		TRUMP	I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines.
0	931.0		TRUMP	The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....
0	932.0		RUBIO	... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...
0	933.0		TRUMP	... You don't know much...
0	934.0		RUBIO	So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states.
0	935.0		RUBIO	What else is part of your healthcare plan...
0	936.0		TRUMP	The lines around the states...
0	937.0		RUBIO	... That's your only plan...
0	938.0		TRUMP	... and, it was almost done -- not now...
0	939.0		RUBIO	... Alright, (inaudible)...
0	940.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	941.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	942.0		RUBIO	... His plan.
0	943.0		RUBIO	That was the plan...
0	944.0		TRUMP	... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition.
0	945.0		TRUMP	So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many.
0	946.0		TRUMP	They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.
0	947.0		RUBIO	Alright...
0	948.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	949.0		RUBIO	So, that's the only part of the plan?
0	950.0		RUBIO	Just the lines?
0	951.0		BASH	(inaudible)
0	952.0		TRUMP	The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans.
0	953.0		TRUMP	You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.
0	954.0		RUBIO	Now he's repeating himself.
0	955.0		TRUMP	No, no, no.

0	965.0		TRUMP	I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody...
0	966.0		BASH	... Let's stay focused on the subject...
0	967.0		TRUMP	I thought he came out of the swimming pool...
0	968.0		RUBIO	I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again...
0	969.0		BASH	Senator Rubio...
0	970.0		RUBIO	... We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls...
0	971.0		BASH	Senator Rubio, please.
0	972.0		RUBIO	... And the lines around the state.
0	973.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)

0	977.0		UNIDENTIFIED MALE	I tell the truth, I tell the truth.
0	978.0		BASH	Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him...
0	979.0		RUBIO	... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right?
0	980.0		RUBIO	OK...
0	981.0		BASH	If you could talk a little bit more about your plan.
0	982.0		BASH	I know you talked about...
0	983.0		TRUMP	... We're going to have many different plans because...
0	984.0		BASH	... Can you be a little specific...
0	985.0		TRUMP	... competition...
0	986.0		RUBIO	He's done it again.
0	987.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	988.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	989.0		TRUMP	There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies.
0	990.0		RUBIO	They're going to have many, many different plans.
0	991.0		BASH	Is there anything else you would like to add to that...
0	992.0		TRUMP	No, there's nothing to add.
0	993.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	994.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	995.0		TRUMP	What is to add?
0	996.0		BASH	Thank you.
0	997.0		BASH	Thank you both.
0	998.0		RUBIO	Alright.
0	999.0		BASH	"Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, ""Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition."""
0	1000.0		BASH	Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?
0	1001.0		KASICH	No, I wouldn't.
0	1002.0		KASICH	And -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions.
0	1003.0		KASICH	You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick.
0	1004.0		KASICH	Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight.
0	1005.0		KASICH	We're actually running significant health reform in my state.
0	1006.0		KASICH	I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons.
0	1007.0		KASICH	I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.
0	1008.0		KASICH	And then we're driving towards total transparency.
0	1009.0		KASICH	If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill.
0	1010.0		KASICH	The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.
0	1011.0		KASICH	And I'll tell you what we will do.
0	1012.0		KASICH	We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices.
0	1013.0		KASICH	We actually are going to make the market work.
0	1014.0		BASH	Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate.
0	1015.0		BASH	In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate.
0	1016.0		BASH	So what changed?
0	1017.0		KASICH	Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well.
0	1018.0		KASICH	And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable.
0	1019.0		KASICH	And we don't need to do that.
0	1020.0		KASICH	Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low.
0	1021.0		KASICH	If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.
0	1022.0		KASICH	That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.
0	1023.0		KASICH	Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher.
0	1024.0		KASICH	And you know what?
0	1025.0		KASICH	At some point, people can't afford it.
0	1026.0		KASICH	Our plan will work.
0	1027.0		KASICH	It uses the market.
0	1028.0		KASICH	It uses transparency.
0	1029.0		KASICH	It gets the patient in the middle.
0	1030.0		KASICH	And guess what?
0	1031.0		KASICH	We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country.
0	1032.0		KASICH	And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on.
0	1033.0		KASICH	We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.
0	1034.0		KASICH	We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana.
0	1035.0		KASICH	So that's really what we're doing.
0	1036.0		KASICH	This is not a theory.
0	1037.0		KASICH	This is what we are actually doing in our state.
0	1038.0		KASICH	We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives.
0	1039.0		KASICH	If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what?
0	1040.0		KASICH	They will get a financial reward.
0	1041.0		KASICH	Our primary care physicians need help.
0	1042.0		KASICH	They need support.
0	1043.0		KASICH	We're losing them.
0	1044.0		KASICH	This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.
0	1045.0		BASH	Governor Kasich, thank you.
0	1046.0		KASICH	Thank you.
0	1047.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1048.0		BASH	Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients.
0	1049.0		BASH	You support covering preexisting conditions.
0	1050.0		BASH	How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?
0	1051.0		CARSON	Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right.
0	1052.0		CARSON	But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that.
0	1053.0		CARSON	We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.
0	1054.0		CARSON	I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats.
0	1055.0		CARSON	And we give it to everybody from birth until death.
0	1056.0		CARSON	They can pass it on when they die.
0	1057.0		CARSON	We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with.
0	1058.0		CARSON	We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family.
0	1059.0		CARSON	So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.
0	1060.0		CARSON	And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man.
0	1061.0		CARSON	It gives you enormous flexibility.
0	1062.0		CARSON	And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.
0	1063.0		CARSON	Also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare.
0	1064.0		CARSON	So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered.
0	1065.0		CARSON	One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year.
0	1066.0		CARSON	You can buy the $1,500 one.
0	1067.0		CARSON	That will take care of 75 percent of the people.
0	1068.0		CARSON	The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?
0	1069.0		CARSON	Medicaid.
0	1070.0		CARSON	What's the Medicaid budget?
0	1071.0		CARSON	Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.
0	1072.0		CARSON	But do the math.
0	1073.0		CARSON	Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility.
0	1074.0		CARSON	What could you buy with that?
0	1075.0		CARSON	A concierge practice.
0	1076.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1077.0		CARSON	And you could still have thousands of dollars left over.
0	1078.0		CARSON	And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much.
0	1079.0		CARSON	And, you know, let's...
0	1080.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1081.0		CARSON	... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance.
0	1082.0		CARSON	But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.
0	1083.0		CARSON	It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.
0	1084.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1085.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1086.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.

0	1089.0		CRUZ	Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.
0	1090.0		CRUZ	Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?
0	1091.0		BLITZER	I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...
0	1092.0		CRUZ	It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.
0	1093.0		BLITZER	I know you do.
0	1094.0		BLITZER	And -- all right, go ahead.

0	1097.0		KASICH	How do you -- how do you get that extra time, Cruz?
0	1098.0		KASICH	You're very good at...
0	1099.0		CRUZ	You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements.
0	1100.0		CRUZ	On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful.
0	1101.0		CRUZ	I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.
0	1102.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1103.0		CRUZ	On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons.
1	1104.0		CRUZ	I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care.
0	1105.0		CRUZ	Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough.
0	1106.0		CRUZ	And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.
0	1107.0		CRUZ	What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.
0	1108.0		CRUZ	Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years.
0	1109.0		CRUZ	Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.
0	1110.0		CRUZ	I'll tell you this.
0	1111.0		CRUZ	As president...
0	1112.0		BLITZER	Senator...
0	1113.0		CRUZ	I will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0	1114.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1115.0		BLITZER	Thank you, thank you.
0	1116.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0	1117.0		TRUMP	I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand.
0	1118.0		TRUMP	He goes around saying oh, he wants it.
0	1119.0		TRUMP	I do not want socialized medicine.
0	1120.0		TRUMP	I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.
0	1121.0		TRUMP	In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on.
0	1122.0		TRUMP	That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium.
0	1123.0		TRUMP	You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more.
0	1124.0		TRUMP	We have to get rid of Obamacare.
0	1125.0		TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy completely.
0	1126.0		TRUMP	Our economy is not doing well.
0	1127.0		TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy greatly.
0	1128.0		TRUMP	And on that, I agree.
0	1129.0		CRUZ	Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.
0	1130.0		TRUMP	That's false.
0	1131.0		CRUZ	You've never said that?
0	1132.0		TRUMP	No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...
0	1133.0		CRUZ	But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.
0	1134.0		TRUMP	No, I did not.
0	1135.0		TRUMP	No I did not.
0	1136.0		CRUZ	Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.
0	1137.0		TRUMP	Correct.
0	1138.0		TRUMP	I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.
0	1139.0		CRUZ	Have you said you're a liberal on health care?
0	1140.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	1141.0		TRUMP	Let me talk.
0	1142.0		TRUMP	If people...
0	1143.0		CRUZ	Talk away.
0	1144.0		CRUZ	Explain your plan, please.
0	1145.0		TRUMP	If people -- my plan is very simple.
0	1146.0		TRUMP	I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president.
0	1147.0		TRUMP	You may let it and you may be fine with it...
0	1148.0		CRUZ	So does the government pay for everyone's health care?
0	1149.0		TRUMP	I'm not fine with it.
0	1150.0		TRUMP	We are going to take those people...
0	1151.0		CRUZ	Yes or no.
0	1152.0		CRUZ	Just answer the question.
0	1153.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	1154.0		TRUMP	We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.
0	1155.0		TRUMP	We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.
0	1156.0		CRUZ	Who pays for it?
0	1157.0		RUBIO	Well, can I just clarify something?
0	1158.0		BLITZER	Gentleman, please.
0	1159.0		RUBIO	Wolf, no.
0	1160.0		RUBIO	I want to clarify something.
0	1161.0		BLITZER	Gentlemen please.
0	1162.0		BLITZER	I want to move on.
0	1163.0		RUBIO	This is a Republican debate, right?
0	1164.0		RUBIO	Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...
0	1165.0		BLITZER	I want to talk about the economy.
0	1166.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1167.0		BLITZER	Gentleman, gentleman.
0	1168.0		BLITZER	All of you have agreed -- Senator Cruz...
0	1169.0		TRUMP	You know what?
0	1170.0		TRUMP	Call it what you want.
0	1171.0		CRUZ	It's a yes or no.
0	1172.0		TRUMP	Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.
0	1173.0		BLITZER	All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules.
0	1174.0		BLITZER	I want to move on.
0	1175.0		BLITZER	We're talking about the economy right now.
0	1176.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did.
0	1177.0		BLITZER	The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.
0	1178.0		BLITZER	How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?
0	1179.0		TRUMP	Because the country will become a dynamic economy.
0	1180.0		TRUMP	We'll be dynamic again.
1	1181.0		TRUMP	If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.
1	1182.0		TRUMP	We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.
1	1183.0		TRUMP	We have the highest taxes in the world.
0	1184.0		TRUMP	It's shutting off our economy.
0	1185.0		TRUMP	It's shutting off our country.
0	1186.0		TRUMP	We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.
0	1187.0		TRUMP	Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.
0	1188.0		TRUMP	We will have a dynamic economy again.
0	1189.0		BLITZER	What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?
0	1190.0		TRUMP	We're going to make many cuts in business.
0	1191.0		TRUMP	We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things.
0	1192.0		TRUMP	Department of Education -- Common Core is out.
0	1193.0		TRUMP	We're going local.
0	1194.0		TRUMP	Have to go local.
0	1195.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1196.0		TRUMP	Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money.
0	1197.0		TRUMP	We're going to bring that back to the states.
0	1198.0		TRUMP	And we're going to have other (inaudible) many things.
0	1199.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1200.0		TRUMP	We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.
0	1201.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump.
0	1202.0		BLITZER	If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion.
0	1203.0		BLITZER	If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that's about $8 billion.
0	1204.0		BLITZER	That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.
0	1205.0		BLITZER	The current deficit this year is $544 billion.
0	1206.0		BLITZER	Where are you going to come up with the money?
0	1207.0		TRUMP	Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place.
0	1208.0		TRUMP	Waste, fraud and abuse.
0	1209.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1210.0		TRUMP	You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse.
0	1211.0		TRUMP	We will cut so much, your head will spin.
0	1212.0		BLITZER	Governor Kasich.
0	1213.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1214.0		BLITZER	When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee.
0	1215.0		BLITZER	You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.
0	1216.0		BLITZER	Can Mr. Trump's plan work?
0	1217.0		KASICH	Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf.
0	1218.0		KASICH	And I've done it.
0	1219.0		KASICH	I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced.
0	1220.0		KASICH	We cut the capital gains tax.
0	1221.0		KASICH	You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.
0	1222.0		KASICH	And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance.
0	1223.0		KASICH	We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.
0	1224.0		KASICH	And why do you do it?
0	1225.0		KASICH	Because you want job growth.
0	1226.0		KASICH	If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there.
0	1227.0		KASICH	You will never be able to do it.
0	1228.0		KASICH	Now, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan.
0	1229.0		KASICH	And it's not all -- it's not always cutting.
0	1230.0		KASICH	It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price.
0	1231.0		KASICH	Now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0	1232.0		KASICH	Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.
0	1233.0		KASICH	And, look -- I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.
0	1234.0		KASICH	I've done it -- I did it in Washington -- four years of balanced budgets.
0	1235.0		KASICH	No one could even believe it happened.
0	1236.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	1237.0		KASICH	I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.
0	1238.0		KASICH	And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people.
0	1239.0		KASICH	I promise you that.
0	1240.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1241.0		KASICH	Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.
0	1242.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1243.0		BLITZER	Thank you, governor.
0	1244.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1245.0		BLITZER	Speaking of taxes...
0	1246.0		TRUMP	I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.
0	1247.0		KASICH	OK, let me -- let me -- let me just talk about that, because I know that -- that Donald believes the energy industry is important.
0	1248.0		KASICH	So do I.
1	1249.0		KASICH	But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.
0	1250.0		KASICH	See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly.
0	1251.0		KASICH	We have diversified our economy.
0	1252.0		KASICH	We -- we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon -- their Cloud computing in the Midwest.
0	1253.0		KASICH	You know why it's happening?
0	1254.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	1255.0		KASICH	Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs.
0	1256.0		KASICH	Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.
0	1257.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1258.0		BLITZER	"Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, ""there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them."""
0	1259.0		BLITZER	Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people.
0	1260.0		BLITZER	Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?
0	1261.0		TRUMP	All right.
0	1262.0		TRUMP	First of all, let me just explain.
0	1263.0		TRUMP	I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages.
0	1264.0		TRUMP	You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.
0	1265.0		TRUMP	You learn it from statements.
0	1266.0		TRUMP	I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.
0	1267.0		TRUMP	I built a great company with very little debt.
0	1268.0		TRUMP	People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down.
0	1269.0		TRUMP	And I filed it on time.
0	1270.0		TRUMP	I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.
0	1271.0		TRUMP	So as far as that's concerned, I filed it.
0	1272.0		TRUMP	And that's where you find out what kind of a company.
0	1273.0		TRUMP	You don't learn anything from a tax return.
0	1274.0		TRUMP	I will say this.
0	1275.0		TRUMP	Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.
0	1276.0		TRUMP	And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.
0	1277.0		TRUMP	And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election.
0	1278.0		TRUMP	And it cost him big league.
0	1279.0		TRUMP	As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year.
0	1280.0		TRUMP	Twelve years, or something like that.
0	1281.0		TRUMP	Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.
0	1282.0		TRUMP	Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people.
0	1283.0		TRUMP	They never get audited.
0	1284.0		TRUMP	I get audited every year.
1	1285.0		TRUMP	I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.
0	1286.0		TRUMP	And I think people would understand that.
0	1287.0		BLITZER	Hugh, go ahead.
0	1288.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump.
0	1289.0		HEWITT	You told me...
0	1290.0		TRUMP	Are you going to ask anybody else that question?
0	1291.0		CARSON	Yes, amen, amen.
0	1292.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1293.0		TRUMP	Every single question comes to me?
0	1294.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump...
0	1295.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1296.0		TRUMP	I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.
0	1297.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1298.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.
0	1299.0		TRUMP	True.
0	1300.0		HEWITT	Are you going back on your commitment?
0	1301.0		TRUMP	No, I'm not.
0	1302.0		TRUMP	First of all, very few people listen to your radio show.
0	1303.0		TRUMP	That's the good news.
0	1304.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1305.0		TRUMP	Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true.
0	1306.0		TRUMP	Check out the ratings.
0	1307.0		TRUMP	Look, let me just tell you something.
0	1308.0		TRUMP	Let me just tell you something.
0	1309.0		TRUMP	I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.
0	1310.0		TRUMP	We're under a routine audit.
0	1311.0		TRUMP	I've had it for years, I get audited.
0	1312.0		TRUMP	And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return.
0	1313.0		TRUMP	As soon as the audit is done, I love it.
0	1314.0		HEWITT	So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns.
0	1315.0		HEWITT	Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released.
0	1316.0		HEWITT	And you said, coming out any day momentarily.
0	1317.0		HEWITT	When are we going to see your returns?
0	1318.0		RUBIO	Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them.
0	1319.0		RUBIO	And there's nothing really that interesting in them.
0	1320.0		RUBIO	So I have no problem releasing them.
0	1321.0		RUBIO	And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.
0	1322.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1323.0		RUBIO	But this is my time.
0	1324.0		RUBIO	I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt.
0	1325.0		RUBIO	This is an important issue.
0	1326.0		RUBIO	It's a huge issue, OK?
0	1327.0		RUBIO	In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.
0	1328.0		RUBIO	That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.
0	1329.0		RUBIO	You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.
0	1330.0		RUBIO	And I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis.
0	1331.0		RUBIO	And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question.
0	1332.0		RUBIO	This debt issue is -- the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.
0	1333.0		RUBIO	It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis.
0	1334.0		RUBIO	And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.
0	1335.0		HEWITT	Thank you, Senator Rubio.
0	1336.0		HEWITT	But I am...
0	1337.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1338.0		HEWITT	I'm being fair to all of the candidates.
0	1339.0		HEWITT	Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away.
0	1340.0		HEWITT	Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?
0	1341.0		CRUZ	So, I've released five years of tax returns already.
0	1342.0		CRUZ	We will have two more years available tomorrow.
0	1343.0		CRUZ	And I would note that this question really goes -- you know, Donald says he's being audited.
0	1344.0		CRUZ	Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns.
0	1345.0		CRUZ	If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.
0	1346.0		CRUZ	And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis.
0	1347.0		CRUZ	The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016.
0	1348.0		CRUZ	And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.
0	1349.0		CRUZ	Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...
0	1350.0		TRUMP	Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.
1	1351.0		CRUZ	... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them.
1	1352.0		CRUZ	In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary.
0	1353.0		CRUZ	And this is an example.
0	1354.0		CRUZ	You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now.
0	1355.0		CRUZ	They're going to pick apart his taxes.
0	1356.0		CRUZ	They're going to pick apart his business deals.
0	1357.0		CRUZ	And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.
0	1358.0		CRUZ	The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary.
0	1359.0		CRUZ	"And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, ""but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding."""
0	1360.0		CRUZ	He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.
0	1361.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1362.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1363.0		TRUMP	So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat.
0	1364.0		TRUMP	And I have, over the years.
0	1365.0		TRUMP	I'm a businessman.
0	1366.0		TRUMP	I have, over the years.
0	1367.0		TRUMP	And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls.
0	1368.0		TRUMP	Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll.
0	1369.0		TRUMP	I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be.
0	1370.0		TRUMP	But I think I'll do very well.
0	1371.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1372.0		TRUMP	But a poll just came out -- a Bloomberg poll -- where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.
0	1373.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1374.0		TRUMP	And -- and here's the thing -- it was sort of funny -- 65 percent of the people don't like you -- I just got 36 percent of the vote, right?
0	1375.0		TRUMP	I just got 46 percent on another one.
0	1376.0		TRUMP	I got 38 percent...

0	1378.0		TRUMP	... on another one.
0	1379.0		TRUMP	That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold.
0	1380.0		TRUMP	"He said a year ago, ""I can't lose South Carolina."""
0	1381.0		TRUMP	I beat him in a landslide.
0	1382.0		TRUMP	Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls.
0	1383.0		TRUMP	One other thing -- Hillary Clinton -- take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll.
1	1384.0		TRUMP	I beat her, and I beat her badly.
0	1385.0		TRUMP	And I -- and I haven't even started at her.
0	1386.0		TRUMP	I only had one little interchange...
0	1387.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1388.0		TRUMP	I only had one little interchange, and that was...
0	1389.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	1390.0		TRUMP	... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist.
0	1391.0		TRUMP	And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary.

0	1398.0		CRUZ	He -- he attacked me, Wolf.
0	1399.0		CRUZ	I get a response.
0	1400.0		BLITZER	I was about to say -- Senator Cruz, respond.
0	1401.0		CRUZ	Thank you.
0	1402.0		CRUZ	Thank -- thank -- thank you very much.
0	1403.0		CRUZ	You know, it's interesting -- Donald went -- went on -- on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance.
0	1404.0		CRUZ	He has yet to say -- he can release past year's tax returns.
0	1405.0		CRUZ	He can do it tomorrow.
0	1406.0		CRUZ	He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...
0	1407.0		TRUMP	Nothing.
0	1408.0		CRUZ	... that is bad.
0	1409.0		CRUZ	If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.
0	1410.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1411.0		CRUZ	They're already prepared.
0	1412.0		CRUZ	The only reason he's not releasing them...
0	1413.0		TRUMP	You -- you don't...
0	1414.0		CRUZ	... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.
0	1415.0		TRUMP	I'm not afraid (inaudible).
0	1416.0		CRUZ	You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University.
0	1417.0		CRUZ	It's a fraud case.
0	1418.0		CRUZ	His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.

0	1422.0		CRUZ	You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?
0	1423.0		CRUZ	And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?
0	1424.0		BLITZER	All right (ph)...
0	1425.0		CRUZ	If -- we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.
0	1426.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
0	1427.0		BLITZER	Mr, -- hold on.
0	1428.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump...
0	1429.0		TRUMP	... first of all, he's talking about the polls.
0	1430.0		TRUMP	I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.
0	1431.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1432.0		CRUZ	But you're not beating Hillary.
0	1433.0		CRUZ	You're not beating Hillary.
0	1434.0		TRUMP	Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?
0	1435.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1436.0		TRUMP	So -- so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly.
0	1437.0		TRUMP	I know you're embarrassed -- I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting -- keep swinging, man (ph).
0	1438.0		TRUMP	Swing for the fences.
0	1439.0		TRUMP	Let me just tell you -- let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case.
0	1440.0		TRUMP	Not a -- it's a civil case.
0	1441.0		TRUMP	It's a case where people want to try and get -- it's a case that is nonsense.
0	1442.0		TRUMP	It's something I could have settled many times.
0	1443.0		TRUMP	I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.
0	1444.0		TRUMP	The people that took the course all signed -- most -- many -- many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.
0	1445.0		TRUMP	As -- and believe me, I'll win that case.
0	1446.0		TRUMP	That's an easy case.
0	1447.0		TRUMP	Civil case.
0	1448.0		TRUMP	Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited.
0	1449.0		TRUMP	It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.
0	1450.0		TRUMP	Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited -- which is a very large company.
0	1451.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	1452.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1453.0		TRUMP	I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.
0	1454.0		TRUMP	Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...
0	1455.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1456.0		CRUZ	... the years you're not being audited?
0	1457.0		CRUZ	Will you release those years?

0	1459.0		TRUMP	(inaudible) audited for those years.
0	1460.0		CRUZ	Which years?
0	1461.0		CRUZ	Which years are you being audited?
0	1462.0		BLITZER	Gentlemen...
0	1463.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1464.0		BLITZER	... we actually have rules -- we're trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed.
0	1465.0		BLITZER	We're going to take a quick break.
0	1466.0		BLITZER	We have a lot more -- many more critically important issues to discuss.
0	1467.0		BLITZER	Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.
0	1468.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1469.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	1470.0		BLITZER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.
0	1471.0		BLITZER	Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security.
0	1472.0		BLITZER	And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you.
0	1473.0		TRUMP	Shocking.
0	1474.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1475.0		BLITZER	"You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- I'm quoting you now: ""Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps."""
0	1476.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	1477.0		BLITZER	Here's the question.
0	1478.0		BLITZER	How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?
0	1479.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right?
0	1480.0		TRUMP	I think he's treated Israel horribly.
0	1481.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1482.0		TRUMP	I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel.
0	1483.0		TRUMP	I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.
0	1484.0		TRUMP	As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally.
0	1485.0		TRUMP	And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.
0	1486.0		TRUMP	Now, I may not be successful in doing it.
0	1487.0		TRUMP	It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind.
0	1488.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	1489.0		TRUMP	"But it doesn't help if I start saying, ""I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage."""
0	1490.0		TRUMP	But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.
0	1491.0		TRUMP	And I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides.
0	1492.0		TRUMP	With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.
0	1493.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz?
0	1494.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1495.0		CRUZ	Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly.
0	1496.0		CRUZ	Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.
0	1497.0		CRUZ	Let me be clear.
0	1498.0		CRUZ	If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.
0	1499.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1500.0		CRUZ	And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media.
0	1501.0		CRUZ	Listen, it is not equivalent.
0	1502.0		CRUZ	When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel.
0	1503.0		CRUZ	And I will not pretend that they are.
0	1504.0		CRUZ	Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber.
0	1505.0		CRUZ	And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel.
0	1506.0		CRUZ	I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel.
0	1507.0		CRUZ	And this -- if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.
0	1508.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1509.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0	1510.0		TRUMP	Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years.
0	1511.0		TRUMP	I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before.
0	1512.0		TRUMP	I have a great relationship with Israel.
0	1513.0		TRUMP	And I'm going to keep it that way.
0	1514.0		TRUMP	And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing.
0	1515.0		TRUMP	It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.
0	1516.0		BLITZER	Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.
0	1517.0		KASICH	Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee.
0	1518.0		KASICH	And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things.
0	1519.0		KASICH	And I've been a supporter of Israel -- a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage.
0	1520.0		KASICH	I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.
0	1521.0		KASICH	And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with.
0	1522.0		KASICH	Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving.
0	1523.0		KASICH	And one -- are moving because they're not sure what we will do.
0	1524.0		KASICH	It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours.
0	1525.0		KASICH	We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system.
0	1526.0		KASICH	It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.
0	1527.0		KASICH	When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.
0	1528.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1529.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1530.0		BLITZER	We're going to get to North Korea in a moment.
0	1531.0		BLITZER	But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?
0	1532.0		RUBIO	Because -- and I don't know if Donald realizes this.
0	1533.0		RUBIO	I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps.
0	1534.0		RUBIO	But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position.
0	1535.0		RUBIO	And here's why.
0	1536.0		RUBIO	Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith.
0	1537.0		RUBIO	The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels.
0	1538.0		RUBIO	Instead, here's what the Palestinians do.
0	1539.0		RUBIO	They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing.
0	1540.0		RUBIO	Here's what Hamas does.
0	1541.0		RUBIO	They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis.
0	1542.0		RUBIO	The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.
0	1543.0		RUBIO	And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel.
0	1544.0		RUBIO	"I'm not -- I'm not going to sit here and say, ""Oh, I'm not on either side."""
0	1545.0		RUBIO	I will be on a side.
0	1546.0		RUBIO	I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.
0	1547.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1548.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0	1549.0		TRUMP	I'm a negotiator.
0	1550.0		TRUMP	I've done very well over the years through negotiation.
0	1551.0		TRUMP	It's very important that we do that.
0	1552.0		TRUMP	In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.
0	1553.0		TRUMP	I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
0	1554.0		TRUMP	He's not going down -- excuse me...
0	1555.0		RUBIO	He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.
0	1556.0		TRUMP	... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie.
0	1557.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	1558.0		RUBIO	The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.
0	1559.0		TRUMP	OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal.
0	1560.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you that.
0	1561.0		TRUMP	I learned a long time ago.
0	1562.0		RUBIO	A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists.
0	1563.0		RUBIO	Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?
0	1564.0		TRUMP	You are not a negotiator.
0	1565.0		TRUMP	You are not a negotiator.
0	1566.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1567.0		TRUMP	And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace.
0	1568.0		TRUMP	You will never bring peace...
0	1569.0		RUBIO	... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal...
0	1570.0		TRUMP	Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...
0	1571.0		BLITZER	Senator.
0	1572.0		TRUMP	He will never be able to do it.
0	1573.0		TRUMP	I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this.
0	1574.0		TRUMP	Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.
0	1575.0		BLITZER	Let's move on to talk about North Korea.
0	1576.0		BLITZER	You raised it, Governor Kasich.
0	1577.0		BLITZER	The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its allies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened.
0	1578.0		BLITZER	You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.
0	1579.0		BLITZER	Let's be clear.
0	1580.0		BLITZER	Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?
0	1581.0		KASICH	When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change.
0	1582.0		KASICH	That's what it means.
0	1583.0		KASICH	Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.
0	1584.0		KASICH	But, look, here's what I think we ought to do -- like, immediately.
0	1585.0		KASICH	And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years.
0	1586.0		KASICH	We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.
0	1587.0		KASICH	Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.
0	1588.0		KASICH	Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea.
0	1589.0		KASICH	We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology.
0	1590.0		KASICH	And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology.
0	1591.0		KASICH	Because we're now starting to take a firm position.
0	1592.0		KASICH	We have the attention of the Chinese.
0	1593.0		KASICH	The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.
0	1594.0		KASICH	But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means.
0	1595.0		KASICH	Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time.
0	1596.0		KASICH	You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese.
0	1597.0		KASICH	And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.
0	1598.0		KASICH	They are the key to being able to settle this situation.
0	1599.0		BLITZER	I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important.
0	1600.0		BLITZER	There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...
0	1601.0		KASICH	I'm very well aware of that.
0	1602.0		BLITZER	A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between.
0	1603.0		BLITZER	Would you risk war for a regime change?
0	1604.0		KASICH	Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening.
0	1605.0		KASICH	What the situation was.
0	1606.0		KASICH	But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability?
0	1607.0		KASICH	Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.
0	1608.0		KASICH	But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul.
0	1609.0		KASICH	So, you don't just run around making charges.
0	1610.0		KASICH	I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.
0	1611.0		KASICH	Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear.
0	1612.0		KASICH	We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...
0	1613.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)
0	1614.0		KASICH	... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.
0	1615.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
0	1616.0		TRUMP	One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars.
0	1617.0		TRUMP	We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.
0	1618.0		TRUMP	You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries.
0	1619.0		TRUMP	Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit.
0	1620.0		TRUMP	They're coming out of these countries.
0	1621.0		TRUMP	They are making a fortune.
0	1622.0		TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia.
0	1623.0		TRUMP	Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty.
0	1624.0		TRUMP	They were making $1 billion dollars a day.
0	1625.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)
0	1626.0		TRUMP	We defend all of these countries for peanuts.
0	1627.0		TRUMP	You talk about budgets.
0	1628.0		TRUMP	We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.
0	1629.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1630.0		KASICH	Hey, Wolf, Wolf...
0	1631.0		BLITZER	Dr. Carson.
0	1632.0		KASICH	Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this.
0	1633.0		KASICH	Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more.
0	1634.0		KASICH	We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job.
0	1635.0		KASICH	There is no question about it.
0	1636.0		KASICH	But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military.
0	1637.0		KASICH	Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense.
0	1638.0		KASICH	We need to rebuild our defenses,
0	1639.0		KASICH	But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.
0	1640.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)
0	1641.0		KASICH	We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years.
0	1642.0		KASICH	We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...
0	1643.0		BLITZER	Thank you...
0	1644.0		KASICH	... these resources into strengthening the military.
0	1645.0		KASICH	So, we can do it all...
0	1646.0		BLITZER	Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?
0	1647.0		CARSON	OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time.
0	1648.0		CARSON	I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel.
0	1649.0		CARSON	Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes.
0	1650.0		CARSON	I had something to say about that.
0	1651.0		CARSON	Now...
0	1652.0		BLITZER	Go ahead.
0	1653.0		BLITZER	This is your moment.
0	1654.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1655.0		CARSON	OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.
0	1656.0		CARSON	You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings.
0	1657.0		CARSON	And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year.
0	1658.0		CARSON	And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year.
0	1659.0		CARSON	They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.
0	1660.0		CARSON	But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.
0	1661.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1662.0		CARSON	And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people.
0	1663.0		CARSON	I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel.
0	1664.0		CARSON	You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel.
0	1665.0		CARSON	It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people.
0	1666.0		CARSON	We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.
0	1667.0		CARSON	And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength.
0	1668.0		CARSON	And I think we have to present strength to him.
0	1669.0		CARSON	We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea.
0	1670.0		CARSON	We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.
0	1671.0		CARSON	And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities.
0	1672.0		CARSON	We need to be able to defend ourselves.
0	1673.0		CARSON	And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.
0	1674.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1675.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1676.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1677.0		BLITZER	We're going to continue with national security.
0	1678.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Hugh.
0	1679.0		HEWITT	Thank you, Wolf.
0	1680.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia.
0	1681.0		HEWITT	Do you support this ceasefire?
0	1682.0		TRUMP	I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.
0	1683.0		TRUMP	So It's a meaningless ceasefire.
0	1684.0		TRUMP	I love the idea of a ceasefire.
0	1685.0		TRUMP	I love the idea of -- with a total cessation.
0	1686.0		TRUMP	But it's not working, as you know very well.
0	1687.0		TRUMP	It's not working.
0	1688.0		TRUMP	If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.
0	1689.0		TRUMP	So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.
0	1690.0		HEWITT	Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.
0	1691.0		CRUZ	Well look.
0	1692.0		CRUZ	We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical.
0	1693.0		CRUZ	Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria.
0	1694.0		CRUZ	And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.
0	1695.0		CRUZ	One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
1	1696.0		CRUZ	So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya.
0	1697.0		CRUZ	That was a disaster.
0	1698.0		CRUZ	It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.
0	1699.0		CRUZ	Another example is John Kerry.
0	1700.0		CRUZ	John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.
0	1701.0		CRUZ	I voted against him.
0	1702.0		CRUZ	And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check.
0	1703.0		CRUZ	And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen.
0	1704.0		CRUZ	His diplomacy has been a disaster.
0	1705.0		CRUZ	And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.
0	1706.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1707.0		HEWITT	A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.
0	1708.0		TRUMP	Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest.
0	1709.0		TRUMP	I think they both liked me very much.
0	1710.0		TRUMP	But the fact is that ...
0	1711.0		CRUZ	But you called for Bush to be impeached.
0	1712.0		TRUMP	Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned.
0	1713.0		TRUMP	You know it and so do I.
0	1714.0		CRUZ	But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.
0	1715.0		TRUMP	Be honest.
0	1716.0		TRUMP	Be honest.
0	1717.0		TRUMP	No, this was before.
0	1718.0		TRUMP	The check came early.
0	1719.0		TRUMP	But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria.
0	1720.0		TRUMP	He said I was in favor of Libya?
1	1721.0		TRUMP	I never discussed that subject.
0	1722.0		TRUMP	I was in favor of Libya?
0	1723.0		TRUMP	We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.
0	1724.0		TRUMP	If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?
0	1725.0		TRUMP	And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting.
0	1726.0		TRUMP	You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil.
0	1727.0		TRUMP	As we speak, it's a total mess.
0	1728.0		TRUMP	We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.
0	1729.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1730.0		HEWITT	Senator Rubio.
0	1731.0		RUBIO	Yes, a couple of points.
0	1732.0		RUBIO	Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi.
0	1733.0		RUBIO	The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?
0	1734.0		RUBIO	And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum.
0	1735.0		RUBIO	And that's what happened.
0	1736.0		RUBIO	"That's where the term ""lead from behind"" came."
0	1737.0		RUBIO	And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.
0	1738.0		RUBIO	On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department.
0	1739.0		RUBIO	And she was absolutely horrible.
0	1740.0		RUBIO	I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.
0	1741.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1742.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1743.0		RUBIO	And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief.
0	1744.0		RUBIO	Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief.
0	1745.0		RUBIO	And he's saying these guys need to do more.
0	1746.0		RUBIO	South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.
0	1747.0		RUBIO	And Japan contributes as well.
0	1748.0		RUBIO	And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.
0	1749.0		RUBIO	They can do that very quickly.
0	1750.0		RUBIO	And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.
0	1751.0		HEWITT	Mr. Trump.
0	1752.0		TRUMP	I never said walk away.
0	1753.0		TRUMP	I wouldn't want to walk away.
0	1754.0		TRUMP	I want them to pay us much more money.
0	1755.0		TRUMP	We cannot afford to subsidize...
0	1756.0		RUBIO	How much?
0	1757.0		TRUMP	A lot.
0	1758.0		TRUMP	I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.
0	1759.0		TRUMP	As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.
0	1760.0		TRUMP	It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.
0	1761.0		TRUMP	I'm no fan of John Kerry.
0	1762.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1763.0		BLITZER	Hold on, hold on, Governor.
0	1764.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz.
0	1765.0		CRUZ	You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya.
0	1766.0		CRUZ	Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0	1767.0		CRUZ	You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth.
0	1768.0		CRUZ	And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.
0	1769.0		CRUZ	With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades.
0	1770.0		CRUZ	That's why I voted against him when he came up.
0	1771.0		CRUZ	And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.
0	1772.0		CRUZ	And I'll give one more example on Israel.
0	1773.0		CRUZ	When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?
0	1774.0		CRUZ	The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London.
0	1775.0		CRUZ	Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.
0	1776.0		CRUZ	During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?
0	1777.0		CRUZ	If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?
0	1778.0		CRUZ	If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel.
0	1779.0		CRUZ	Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.
0	1780.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1781.0		KASICH	There's a critical point that needs to be made here.
0	1782.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1783.0		BLITZER	Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.
0	1784.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump has a right to respond.
0	1785.0		TRUMP	Well, look, my response is very simple.
0	1786.0		TRUMP	There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have.
0	1787.0		TRUMP	Nobody.
0	1788.0		TRUMP	You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action.
0	1789.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1790.0		TRUMP	I've been watching it all my life.
0	1791.0		TRUMP	You are all talk and no action.
0	1792.0		CRUZ	Then name one specific thing you've done.
0	1793.0		TRUMP	What I've seen up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar.
0	1794.0		TRUMP	You have a combination...
0	1795.0		RUBIO	This guy always goes for...
0	1796.0		TRUMP	You have a combination of factors.
0	1797.0		TRUMP	He can't do it...
0	1798.0		RUBIO	This is so typical.
0	1799.0		TRUMP	... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth.
0	1800.0		TRUMP	Other than that, I rest my case.
0	1801.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1802.0		BLITZER	One at a time, gentlemen.

0	1809.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1810.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1811.0		KASICH	There's something -- I want to -- I want to point out something here today that is -- it's so critically important -- about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.
0	1812.0		KASICH	First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago.
0	1813.0		KASICH	They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.
0	1814.0		KASICH	We should have been helping them.
0	1815.0		KASICH	I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria.
0	1816.0		KASICH	But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.
0	1817.0		KASICH	Now, let's talk about Libya.
0	1818.0		KASICH	Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution.
0	1819.0		KASICH	Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi.
0	1820.0		KASICH	They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.
0	1821.0		KASICH	And let me just say to you -- we have ISIS beginning get -- get a foothold in Libya.
0	1822.0		KASICH	We're gonna have to deal with it.
0	1823.0		KASICH	There are not many major cities in Libya.
0	1824.0		KASICH	They're on the coast, which -- mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.
0	1825.0		KASICH	Then we have ISIS in -- in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq.
0	1826.0		KASICH	Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit -- one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...
0	1827.0		BLITZER	All right...
0	1828.0		KASICH	... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...
0	1829.0		BLITZER	Let's continue.
0	1830.0		KASICH	... the need to arm the Ukrainians.
0	1831.0		KASICH	They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...
0	1832.0		BLITZER	Let us continue.
0	1833.0		KASICH	... and assert ourselves as America.
0	1834.0		BLITZER	Let's continue the questioning on ISIS.
0	1835.0		BLITZER	Maria.
0	1836.0		CRUZ	Hold on, Wolf.
0	1837.0		CRUZ	You said I got a response.
0	1838.0		BLITZER	You'll have a chance.
0	1839.0		BLITZER	Maria will pick up...
0	1840.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1841.0		CRUZ	Hold on.
0	1842.0		CRUZ	He called me a liar.
0	1843.0		CRUZ	You're saying I can't respond to being called a liar?
0	1844.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1845.0		BLITZER	Go ahead and respond.
0	1846.0		CRUZ	You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington -- the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.
0	1847.0		CRUZ	And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again.
0	1848.0		CRUZ	"He said, for example, seven months ago -- this is Donald speaking, quote -- ""I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."""
0	1849.0		CRUZ	There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here.
0	1850.0		CRUZ	There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...
0	1851.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)
0	1852.0		CRUZ	... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable.
0	1853.0		CRUZ	And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...
0	1854.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1855.0		CRUZ	"... what he said on national television, Donald yells ""liar."""
0	1856.0		CRUZ	Let me tell you something -- falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...
0	1857.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
0	1858.0		CRUZ	... and it's something Donald does daily.
0	1859.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.

0	1864.0		TRUMP	And I thought it was disgraceful.
0	1865.0		TRUMP	And got a lot of votes because of that -- a lot of votes.
0	1866.0		TRUMP	Took them away from Ben Carson.
0	1867.0		TRUMP	I watched that.
0	1868.0		TRUMP	Probably took them away from me, too.
0	1869.0		TRUMP	But I watched it.
0	1870.0		TRUMP	"I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, ""Voter Violation,"" and then it graded you..."
0	1871.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)

0	1953.0		BLITZER	There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.
0	1954.0		BLITZER	The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.
0	1955.0		BLITZER	Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers.
0	1956.0		BLITZER	And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.
0	1957.0		BLITZER	Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.
0	1958.0		BASH	"Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, ""Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order."""
0	1959.0		BASH	Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?
0	1960.0		RUBIO	No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.
0	1961.0		RUBIO	"Apple initially came out saying, ""We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device."""
0	1962.0		RUBIO	That is not accurate.
0	1963.0		RUBIO	The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.
0	1964.0		RUBIO	And I think they should comply with that.
0	1965.0		RUBIO	If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.
0	1966.0		BASH	So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.
0	1967.0		RUBIO	Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.
0	1968.0		BASH	But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?
0	1969.0		RUBIO	To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?
0	1970.0		BASH	Correct.
0	1971.0		RUBIO	Absolutely.
0	1972.0		RUBIO	That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.
0	1973.0		RUBIO	It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.
0	1974.0		RUBIO	That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world.
0	1975.0		RUBIO	But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.
0	1976.0		RUBIO	Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.
0	1977.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1978.0		BASH	Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America.
0	1979.0		BASH	Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?
0	1980.0		CRUZ	Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question.
0	1981.0		CRUZ	His answer, he was on both sides of the fence.
0	1982.0		CRUZ	He's now agreeing with me.
0	1983.0		CRUZ	And so I'm glad.
0	1984.0		CRUZ	What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order.
0	1985.0		CRUZ	Why?
0	1986.0		CRUZ	Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause.
0	1987.0		CRUZ	In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone.
0	1988.0		CRUZ	If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.
0	1989.0		CRUZ	I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.
0	1990.0		CRUZ	But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed.
0	1991.0		CRUZ	And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.
0	1992.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1993.0		BASH	Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America.
0	1994.0		BASH	What do you think?
0	1995.0		CARSON	I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.
0	1996.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1997.0		CARSON	You know, we have the -- we have a Constitution.
0	1998.0		CARSON	We have a Fourth Amendment.
0	1999.0		CARSON	It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure.
0	2000.0		CARSON	But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.
0	2001.0		CARSON	And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.
0	2002.0		CARSON	So absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order.
0	2003.0		CARSON	If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.
0	2004.0		BASH	Mr. Trump...
0	2005.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2006.0		KASICH	I want to weigh in on this please.
0	2007.0		KASICH	I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple.
0	2008.0		KASICH	You know what the problem is?
0	2009.0		KASICH	Where's the president been?
0	2010.0		KASICH	You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.
0	2011.0		KASICH	You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.
0	2012.0		KASICH	The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces.
0	2013.0		KASICH	And then you know what you do when you're the president?
0	2014.0		KASICH	You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans.
0	2015.0		KASICH	This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.
0	2016.0		KASICH	And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor.
0	2017.0		KASICH	I do this all the time.
0	2018.0		KASICH	And we reach agreements all the time.
0	2019.0		KASICH	Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.
0	2020.0		CELESTE	Thank you, Governor.
0	2021.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2022.0		KASICH	Thank you.
0	2023.0		CELESTE	Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.
0	2024.0		CELESTE	As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat.
0	2025.0		CELESTE	You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada.
0	2026.0		CELESTE	When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't?
0	2027.0		CELESTE	Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?
1	2028.0		TRUMP	First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer.
0	2029.0		TRUMP	You're talking about a massive border.
0	2030.0		TRUMP	We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.
0	2031.0		TRUMP	You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.
0	2032.0		TRUMP	And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful.
0	2033.0		TRUMP	With the trees and the roads, and the countryside.
0	2034.0		TRUMP	Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.
0	2035.0		TRUMP	They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security.
0	2036.0		TRUMP	I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget.
0	2037.0		TRUMP	It'll be a very high wall, a great wall.
0	2038.0		TRUMP	It's going to be built, it's going to be built.
0	2039.0		TRUMP	It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay?
0	2040.0		TRUMP	Got to be paid for by Mexico.
1	2041.0		TRUMP	The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.
1	2042.0		TRUMP	You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.
0	2043.0		TRUMP	It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem.
0	2044.0		TRUMP	I don't care what anyone says.
0	2045.0		TRUMP	It is not our big problem.
0	2046.0		TRUMP	Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.
0	2047.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2048.0		CELESTE	I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico.
0	2049.0		CELESTE	As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars.
0	2050.0		CELESTE	Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt.
0	2051.0		CELESTE	That is the same debt the other 50 states have.
0	2052.0		CELESTE	You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection.
0	2053.0		CELESTE	You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort.
0	2054.0		CELESTE	That that's where they are now.
0	2055.0		CELESTE	How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?
0	2056.0		RUBIO	Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again.
0	2057.0		RUBIO	And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing.
0	2058.0		RUBIO	It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.
0	2059.0		RUBIO	They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there.
0	2060.0		RUBIO	The tax rate is too high.
0	2061.0		RUBIO	The government regulations are too extensive.
0	2062.0		RUBIO	This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next.
0	2063.0		RUBIO	So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again.
0	2064.0		RUBIO	If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.
0	2065.0		RUBIO	So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.
0	2066.0		RUBIO	They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust.
0	2067.0		RUBIO	And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.
0	2068.0		RUBIO	Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...
0	2069.0		SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)
0	2070.0		RUBIO	... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...
0	2071.0		BLITZER	Senator, thank you very much.
0	2072.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2073.0		BLITZER	I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.
0	2074.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)

0	2076.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	2077.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2078.0		BLITZER	Welcome back to the University of Houston.
0	2079.0		BLITZER	It's time now for closing statements.
0	2080.0		BLITZER	All of you will have 30 seconds.
0	2081.0		BLITZER	Dr. Carson, we'll start with you.
0	2082.0		CARSON	Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate.
0	2083.0		CARSON	Think about that.
0	2084.0		CARSON	Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands.
0	2085.0		CARSON	These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families.
0	2086.0		CARSON	And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America.
0	2087.0		CARSON	If not us, who?
0	2088.0		CARSON	And if not now, when?
0	2089.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2090.0		BLITZER	Governor Kasich.
0	2091.0		KASICH	Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage.
0	2092.0		KASICH	Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters.
0	2093.0		KASICH	It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations.
0	2094.0		KASICH	I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.
0	2095.0		KASICH	But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.
0	2096.0		KASICH	I hope you all think about giving me your vote.
0	2097.0		KASICH	I would appreciate it very much.
0	2098.0		KASICH	And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do.
0	2099.0		KASICH	I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again.
0	2100.0		KASICH	Thank you all very much.
0	2101.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2102.0		BLITZER	Senator Rubio.
0	2103.0		RUBIO	Well, thank you for having us tonight.
0	2104.0		RUBIO	You know, this campaign has come a long way.
0	2105.0		RUBIO	It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count.
0	2106.0		RUBIO	And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.
0	2107.0		RUBIO	The time for games is over.
0	2108.0		RUBIO	I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down.
0	2109.0		RUBIO	And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.
0	2110.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2111.0		BLITZER	Senator Cruz.
0	2112.0		CRUZ	Washington deals are bankrupting this country.
0	2113.0		CRUZ	There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.
0	2114.0		CRUZ	If I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action.
0	2115.0		CRUZ	I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.
0	2116.0		CRUZ	I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today.
0	2117.0		CRUZ	I will rip to shreds the Iranian -- catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.
0	2118.0		CRUZ	And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
0	2119.0		CRUZ	We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.
0	2120.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2121.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
0	2122.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	2123.0		TRUMP	Nobody knows politicians better than I do.
0	2124.0		TRUMP	They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done.
0	2125.0		TRUMP	I've watched it for years.
0	2126.0		TRUMP	Take a look at what's happening to our country.
0	2127.0		TRUMP	All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done.
0	2128.0		TRUMP	Politicians will never, ever get it done.
0	2129.0		TRUMP	And we will make America great again.
0	2130.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	2131.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	2132.0		BLITZER	Mr. Trump, thank you.
0	2133.0		BLITZER	And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo.
0	2134.0		BLITZER	We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston.
0	2135.0		BLITZER	My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.
0	2136.0		BLITZER	Super Tuesday is only five days away.
0	1.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules.
0	2.0		BLITZER	As moderator, I'll guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups.
0	3.0		BLITZER	You'll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis.
0	4.0		BLITZER	You'll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups.
0	5.0		BLITZER	Timing lights will signal when your time is up.
0	6.0		BLITZER	Both candidates have agreed to these rules now.
0	7.0		BLITZER	Opening statements, you'll each have two minutes.
0	8.0		BLITZER	Let's begin with Senator Sanders.
0	9.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	10.0		SANDERS	Wolf, thank you very much.
0	11.0		SANDERS	CNN, thank you very much.
0	12.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.
0	13.0		SANDERS	When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls.
0	14.0		SANDERS	We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton.
0	15.0		SANDERS	In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.
0	16.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	17.0		SANDERS	Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.
0	18.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	19.0		SANDERS	Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging -- guess what -- $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.
0	20.0		SANDERS	The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.
0	21.0		SANDERS	And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...
0	22.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	23.0		SANDERS	... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.
0	24.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	25.0		SANDERS	This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.
0	26.0		SANDERS	Thank you.
0	27.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?
0	28.0		CLINTON	Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...
0	29.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	30.0		CLINTON	... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.
0	31.0		CLINTON	I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...
0	32.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	33.0		CLINTON	... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.
0	34.0		CLINTON	And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together.
0	35.0		CLINTON	We faced 9/11.
0	36.0		CLINTON	We worked hard to rebuild New York.
0	37.0		CLINTON	I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.
0	38.0		CLINTON	We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.
0	39.0		CLINTON	And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.
0	40.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	41.0		CLINTON	And that is -- that is exactly what I want to do as your president.
0	42.0		CLINTON	We will celebrate our diversity.
0	43.0		CLINTON	We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America.
0	44.0		CLINTON	That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential.
0	45.0		CLINTON	That is what my campaign is about.
0	46.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	47.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	48.0		BLITZER	We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised.
0	49.0		BLITZER	I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.
0	50.0		BLITZER	Senator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president.
0	51.0		BLITZER	You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.
0	52.0		BLITZER	So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?
0	53.0		SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?
0	54.0		SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	We worked together in the Senate.
0	55.0		SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign.
0	56.0		SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	"Washington Post headline says ""Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified"" and that's what the surrogates were saying."
0	57.0		SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?
0	58.0		SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	Of course she does.
0	59.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	60.0		SANDERS	But I do question...
0	61.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	62.0		SANDERS	-- but I do question her judgment.
0	63.0		SANDERS	I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...
0	64.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	65.0		SANDERS	-- the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.
0	66.0		SANDERS	And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.
0	67.0		SANDERS	I don't believe that that is...
0	68.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	69.0		SANDERS	-- the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.
0	70.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?
1	71.0		HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.
0	72.0		HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	I've been called a lot of things in my life.
1	73.0		HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE	That was a first.
0	74.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	75.0		CLINTON	And then he did say that...
0	76.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	77.0		CLINTON	-- he had to question my judgment.
0	78.0		CLINTON	Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...
0	79.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	80.0		CLINTON	-- and...
0	81.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	82.0		CLINTON	-- and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.
0	83.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	84.0		CLINTON	So, look, we have disagreements on policy.
0	85.0		CLINTON	There's no doubt about it.
0	86.0		CLINTON	"But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks."
0	87.0		CLINTON	When asked, he could not explain how...
0	88.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	89.0		CLINTON	-- that would be done and...
0	90.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	91.0		CLINTON	-- when asked...
0	92.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	93.0		CLINTON	-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.
0	94.0		CLINTON	I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.
0	95.0		BLITZER	Senator...
0	96.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	97.0		SANDERS	And let's talk about judgment.
0	98.0		UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Yes!
0	99.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	100.0		SANDERS	And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...
0	101.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	102.0		SANDERS	I led the opposition to that war.
0	103.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton voted for that.
0	104.0		SANDERS	Well, let's talk about judgment.
1	105.0		SANDERS	Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.
0	106.0		SANDERS	Where does the money come from?
0	107.0		SANDERS	Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?
0	108.0		SANDERS	I don't think so.
0	109.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	110.0		CLINTON	Well, let me...
0	111.0		SANDERS	We have...
0	112.0		CLINTON	-- let me just say...
0	113.0		SANDERS	-- (INAUDIBLE)...
0	114.0		CLINTON	-- let me -- let me say...
0	115.0		BLITZER	Madam Secretary, let him finish.
0	116.0		CLINTON	OK.
0	117.0		SANDERS	Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small.
0	118.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	119.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	120.0		SANDERS	We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people.
0	121.0		SANDERS	So I...
0	122.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	123.0		SANDERS	-- my (INAUDIBLE).
0	124.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	125.0		BLITZER	Secretary?
0	126.0		CLINTON	Well, make -- make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama.
0	127.0		CLINTON	President Obama...
0	128.0		SYSTEM	(BOOS)
0	129.0		CLINTON	You know, let me tell you why.
0	130.0		CLINTON	You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why.
0	131.0		CLINTON	President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.
0	132.0		CLINTON	President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.
0	133.0		CLINTON	And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...
0	134.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	135.0		CLINTON	-- on Wall Street in many a year.
0	136.0		CLINTON	So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.
0	137.0		BLITZER	Thank, Secretary.
0	138.0		BLITZER	We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.
0	139.0		BASH	Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis.
0	140.0		BASH	This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.
0	141.0		BASH	So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?
0	142.0		BASH	Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?
0	143.0		CLINTON	Absolutely.
0	144.0		CLINTON	You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.
0	145.0		CLINTON	No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.
0	146.0		CLINTON	I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.
0	147.0		CLINTON	I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.
0	148.0		CLINTON	I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.
0	149.0		CLINTON	There are two sections there.
0	150.0		CLINTON	If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.
0	151.0		CLINTON	Let's look at what is at stake here.
0	152.0		CLINTON	We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.
0	153.0		CLINTON	I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.
0	154.0		CLINTON	I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.
0	155.0		CLINTON	We've got to execute under it.
0	156.0		CLINTON	So, you're right.
0	157.0		CLINTON	I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.
0	158.0		CLINTON	The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...
0	159.0		BASH	... Thank you, Secretary.
0	160.0		BASH	Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.
0	161.0		BASH	"You said, quote, ""That's their decision."""
0	162.0		BASH	Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?
0	163.0		SANDERS	First, Dana...
0	164.0		BASH	when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?
0	165.0		SANDERS	That's right.
0	166.0		SANDERS	So, let's start off with the basic premise.
0	167.0		SANDERS	A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.
0	168.0		SANDERS	What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.
0	169.0		SANDERS	Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.
0	170.0		SANDERS	Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.
0	171.0		BASH	But, Senator...
0	172.0		SANDERS	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.
0	173.0		BASH	But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?
0	174.0		SANDERS	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.
0	175.0		SANDERS	You've got to be a certain size.
0	176.0		SANDERS	And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.
0	177.0		SANDERS	I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.
0	178.0		SANDERS	What we need is to make sure that they are safe.
0	179.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	180.0		CLINTON	Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn.
0	181.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	182.0		CLINTON	Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.
0	183.0		CLINTON	Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.
0	184.0		CLINTON	That has to be the judgement of the regulators.
0	185.0		CLINTON	But, there's another element to this.
0	186.0		CLINTON	I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.
0	187.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	188.0		CLINTON	They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.
0	189.0		BASH	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
0	190.0		CLINTON	And hold them accountable as well.
0	191.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	192.0		BASH	Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street.
0	193.0		BASH	Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?
0	194.0		SANDERS	Sure.
0	195.0		SANDERS	Sure.
0	196.0		SANDERS	The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.
0	197.0		SANDERS	That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that.
0	198.0		SANDERS	Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.
0	199.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	200.0		SANDERS	So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.
0	201.0		SANDERS	And that's what my legislation does.
0	202.0		CLINTON	Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.
0	203.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	204.0		CLINTON	It is important -- it's always important.
0	205.0		CLINTON	It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.
0	206.0		CLINTON	I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.
0	207.0		CLINTON	I called them out on their mortgage behavior.
0	208.0		CLINTON	I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.
0	209.0		CLINTON	When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.
0	210.0		CLINTON	That is the law.
0	211.0		CLINTON	Now, this is our ninth debate.
0	212.0		CLINTON	In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.
0	213.0		CLINTON	You don't just say, we're upset about this.
0	214.0		CLINTON	I'm upset about it.
0	215.0		CLINTON	You don't just say, go break them up.
0	216.0		CLINTON	You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.
0	217.0		BASH	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
0	218.0		CLINTON	So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.
0	219.0		CLINTON	We've got to include the shadow banking sector.
0	220.0		BASH	Thank you.
0	221.0		BASH	Senator Sanders.
0	222.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	223.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton called them out.
0	224.0		SANDERS	Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.
0	225.0		SANDERS	And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?
0	226.0		SANDERS	So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.
0	227.0		SANDERS	Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference.
0	228.0		SANDERS	These banks, in my view, have too much power.
0	229.0		SANDERS	They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.
0	230.0		SANDERS	If elected president, I will break them up.
0	231.0		SANDERS	We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.
0	232.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	233.0		BASH	Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs.
0	234.0		BASH	So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?
0	235.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	236.0		CLINTON	You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue.
0	237.0		CLINTON	When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.
0	238.0		CLINTON	I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.
0	239.0		CLINTON	I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.
0	240.0		CLINTON	Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.
0	241.0		CLINTON	It was a giant insurance company, AIG.
0	242.0		CLINTON	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.
0	243.0		CLINTON	It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.
0	244.0		CLINTON	I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...
0	245.0		BASH	Madam Secretary...
0	246.0		CLINTON	... but the fact is he did.
0	247.0		CLINTON	And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...
0	248.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	249.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	250.0		BASH	Senator Sanders, one second, please.
0	251.0		BASH	Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.
0	252.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	253.0		BASH	Why not release them?
0	254.0		CLINTON	I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president.
0	255.0		CLINTON	This is a new one.
0	256.0		CLINTON	And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side.
0	257.0		CLINTON	I know that.
0	258.0		CLINTON	But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.
0	259.0		CLINTON	And I've released 30 years of tax returns.
0	260.0		CLINTON	And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.
0	261.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	262.0		BASH	Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination.
0	263.0		CLINTON	Right.
0	264.0		BASH	And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.
0	265.0		BASH	It's not about the Republicans...
0	266.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	267.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	268.0		CLINTON	You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.
0	269.0		CLINTON	When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.
0	270.0		CLINTON	Everybody does it, and then we move forward.
0	271.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	272.0		SANDERS	Well, let me respond.
0	273.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it.
0	274.0		SANDERS	I will do it.
0	275.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	276.0		SANDERS	I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents.
0	277.0		SANDERS	There were no speeches.
0	278.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	279.0		SANDERS	And second of all, of course we will release our taxes.
0	280.0		SANDERS	Jane does our taxes.
0	281.0		SANDERS	We've been a little bit busy lately.
0	282.0		SANDERS	You'll excuse us.
0	283.0		SANDERS	But we will...
0	284.0		BLITZER	Senator...
0	285.0		SANDERS	We will get them out.
0	286.0		BLITZER	Senator...
0	287.0		CLINTON	Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
0	288.0		BLITZER	Senator, when are you -- when are you -- you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.
0	289.0		SANDERS	Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow.
0	290.0		BLITZER	Which one?
0	291.0		SANDERS	Last year's.
0	292.0		BLITZER	2014?
0	293.0		SANDERS	Yes.
0	294.0		BLITZER	What about 2013, all the other ones?
0	295.0		SANDERS	You'll get them, yes.
0	296.0		SANDERS	Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited.
0	297.0		SANDERS	They are very boring tax returns.
0	298.0		SANDERS	No big money from speeches, no major investments.
0	299.0		SANDERS	Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.
0	300.0		SANDERS	And that's what that will show.
0	301.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	302.0		BLITZER	So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?
0	303.0		SANDERS	Yes.
0	304.0		BLITZER	And what about the earlier ones?
0	305.0		BLITZER	What's the problem... SANDERS: Yes.
0	306.0		BLITZER	What's taking so long?
0	307.0		BLITZER	Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.
0	308.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	309.0		SANDERS	Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them.
0	310.0		SANDERS	And she's been out on the campaign trail.
0	311.0		SANDERS	We will get them out.
0	312.0		SANDERS	We'll get them out very shortly.
0	313.0		SANDERS	It's not a big deal.
0	314.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	315.0		BLITZER	Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States.
0	316.0		BLITZER	Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses.
0	317.0		BLITZER	"He says you are, quote, ""uninformed on this issue"" and disconnected from reality."
0	318.0		BLITZER	Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?
0	319.0		SANDERS	Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.
0	320.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	321.0		SANDERS	And this is -- this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country.
0	322.0		SANDERS	This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary.
0	323.0		SANDERS	That's his -- that's his compensation.
0	324.0		SANDERS	This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and -- and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs.
0	325.0		SANDERS	He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.
0	326.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	327.0		BLITZER	All right.
0	328.0		BLITZER	Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?
0	329.0		SANDERS	First of all, the word contempt is not right.
0	330.0		SANDERS	There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.
0	331.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	332.0		SANDERS	Verizon happens not to be one of them.
0	333.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	334.0		SANDERS	And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine.
0	335.0		SANDERS	He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...
0	336.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	337.0		SANDERS	-- cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.
0	338.0		SYSTEM	(BOOS)
0	339.0		BLITZER	But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.
0	340.0		BLITZER	So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?
0	341.0		SANDERS	Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
0	342.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	343.0		SANDERS	And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.
0	344.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	345.0		SANDERS	We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those.
0	346.0		SANDERS	That has got to change.
0	347.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	348.0		BLITZER	Secretary...
0	349.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	350.0		BLITZER	-- Secretary Clinton?
0	351.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	352.0		CLINTON	Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.
0	353.0		CLINTON	And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.
0	354.0		CLINTON	I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.
0	355.0		CLINTON	I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.
0	356.0		CLINTON	And that's exactly what I will do.
0	357.0		CLINTON	When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.
0	358.0		CLINTON	So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting -- more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.
0	359.0		CLINTON	And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.
0	360.0		CLINTON	I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...
0	361.0		BLITZER	Senator...
0	362.0		CLINTON	-- in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.
0	363.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	364.0		CLINTON	Let's do that again in America.
0	365.0		BLITZER	Senator, how do you...
0	366.0		SANDERS	I'm going to respond...
0	367.0		BLITZER	I'll have you respond in a moment.
0	368.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	369.0		BLITZER	Stand by.
0	370.0		SANDERS	Well, look...
0	371.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)
0	372.0		BLITZER	You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.
0	373.0		BLITZER	You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.
0	374.0		BLITZER	But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
0	375.0		BLITZER	As president...
0	376.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	377.0		BLITZER	-- if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?
0	378.0		CLINTON	Well, of course I would.
1	379.0		CLINTON	And I have supported...
0	380.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	381.0		CLINTON	-- I have supported the fight for 15.
0	382.0		CLINTON	I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.
0	383.0		CLINTON	I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage.
0	384.0		CLINTON	I always have.
1	385.0		CLINTON	I supported that when I was in the Senate.
0	386.0		SANDERS	Well, look...
0	387.0		CLINTON	But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York.
0	388.0		CLINTON	If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15.
0	389.0		CLINTON	That is exactly my position.
0	390.0		CLINTON	It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.
0	391.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	392.0		CLINTON	Go as quickly as...
0	393.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	394.0		CLINTON	-- to get to $15.
0	395.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	396.0		SANDERS	I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
0	397.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	398.0		CLINTON	You know, wait a minute...
0	399.0		SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).
0	400.0		CLINTON	-- wait a minute.
0	401.0		SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).
0	402.0		CLINTON	-- wait, wait...
0	403.0		SANDERS	That's just not accurate.
0	404.0		SANDERS	Well...
0	405.0		CLINTON	Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...
0	406.0		SANDERS	-- well and I...
0	407.0		CLINTON	-- with Senator Sanders eight...
0	408.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	409.0		CLINTON	-- times.
0	410.0		SANDERS	Excuse me.
0	411.0		CLINTON	I have said the...
0	412.0		SANDERS	Well...
0	413.0		CLINTON	Exact same thing.
0	414.0		BLITZER	Secretary, Senator, please.
0	415.0		CLINTON	If we can...
0	416.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	417.0		CLINTON	-- raise it to $15 in New York...
0	418.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	419.0		CLINTON	-- or Los Angeles or Seattle...
0	420.0		BLITZER	Secretary, the viewers...
0	421.0		CLINTON	-- let's do it.
0	422.0		BLITZER	If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.
0	423.0		SANDERS	OK.
0	424.0		BLITZER	So please...
0	425.0		SANDERS	I will...
0	426.0		BLITZER	-- don't talk over each other.
0	427.0		SANDERS	I believe I was...
0	428.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	429.0		BLITZER	Go ahead.
0	430.0		SANDERS	-- responding.
0	431.0		SANDERS	All right?
0	432.0		SANDERS	When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.
0	433.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.
0	434.0		SANDERS	There's a difference.
0	435.0		SANDERS	And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.
0	436.0		CLINTON	OK.
0	437.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	438.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Secretary.
0	439.0		BLITZER	Secretary?
0	440.0		SANDERS	And suddenly...
0	441.0		BLITZER	Secretary, go ahead.
0	442.0		SANDERS	To suddenly...
0	443.0		CLINTON	Thank you.
0	444.0		CLINTON	Thank you very much.
0	445.0		SANDERS	To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate.
0	446.0		BLITZER	All right.
0	447.0		BLITZER	Secretary?
0	448.0		CLINTON	All right.
0	449.0		CLINTON	I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.
0	450.0		CLINTON	I supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true.
0	451.0		CLINTON	I also -- I supported the $15 effort in L.A.
0	452.0		CLINTON	I supported in Seattle.
0	453.0		CLINTON	I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.
0	454.0		CLINTON	The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right?
0	455.0		CLINTON	We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that.
1	456.0		CLINTON	I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.
0	457.0		CLINTON	Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference.
0	458.0		CLINTON	Thirty-five million people will get a raise.
0	459.0		CLINTON	One in four working mothers will get a raise.
0	460.0		CLINTON	I want to get something done.
1	461.0		CLINTON	And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15.
0	462.0		CLINTON	But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.
0	463.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	464.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
0	465.0		SANDERS	Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.
0	466.0		SANDERS	I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.
0	467.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	468.0		SANDERS	Now, in fact -- in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage.
0	469.0		SANDERS	That's good.
0	470.0		SANDERS	I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.
0	471.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	472.0		SANDERS	And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...
0	473.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	474.0		SANDERS	I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.
0	475.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	476.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	477.0		BLITZER	We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America.
0	478.0		BLITZER	"Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, ""the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York."""
0	479.0		BLITZER	But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.
0	480.0		BLITZER	Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?
0	481.0		CLINTON	No, of course not.
0	482.0		CLINTON	Of course not.
0	483.0		CLINTON	This is -- this is a serious difference between us.
0	484.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	485.0		CLINTON	And what I want to start by saying -- it's not a laughing matter -- 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year.
0	486.0		CLINTON	I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.
0	487.0		CLINTON	So, yes, we have a problem in America.
0	488.0		CLINTON	We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.
0	489.0		CLINTON	We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.
0	490.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	491.0		CLINTON	And what we have here is a big difference.
0	492.0		CLINTON	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.
0	493.0		CLINTON	He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.
0	494.0		CLINTON	Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield.
0	495.0		CLINTON	He said they didn't deserve their day in court.
0	496.0		CLINTON	I could not disagree more.
0	497.0		CLINTON	And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.
0	498.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	499.0		CLINTON	That has this kind of special protection.
0	500.0		CLINTON	We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree.
0	501.0		CLINTON	We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...
0	502.0		BLITZER	... Thank you...
0	503.0		CLINTON	... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?
0	504.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	505.0		BLITZER	Senator?
0	506.0		BLITZER	Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.
0	507.0		BLITZER	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.
0	508.0		BLITZER	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.
0	509.0		BLITZER	You made the point what she said was totally absurd.
0	510.0		BLITZER	I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence.
0	511.0		BLITZER	She said no.
0	512.0		BLITZER	But, go ahead.
0	513.0		SANDERS	Then why did she put out that statement?
0	514.0		CLINTON	I put it out...
0	515.0		SANDERS	... Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.
0	516.0		BLITZER	Please, go ahead sir.
0	517.0		SANDERS	A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.
0	518.0		SANDERS	Here is the fact on guns.
0	519.0		SANDERS	Let's talk about guns.
0	520.0		SANDERS	That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.
0	521.0		SANDERS	Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont.
0	522.0		SANDERS	I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?
0	523.0		SANDERS	We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.
0	524.0		SANDERS	I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.
0	525.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	526.0		SANDERS	And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.
0	527.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	528.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	529.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	530.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	531.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?
1	532.0		CLINTON	Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.
1	533.0		CLINTON	They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.
0	534.0		CLINTON	But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.
0	535.0		CLINTON	He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.
0	536.0		CLINTON	And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.
0	537.0		CLINTON	He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.
0	538.0		CLINTON	So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.
0	539.0		CLINTON	Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.
0	540.0		CLINTON	Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.
0	541.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	542.0		BLITZER	Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.
0	543.0		BLITZER	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.
0	544.0		BLITZER	The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.
0	545.0		BLITZER	Do you?
0	546.0		SANDERS	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.
0	547.0		SANDERS	Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.
0	548.0		SANDERS	But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.
0	549.0		SANDERS	They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.
0	550.0		BLITZER	So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?
0	551.0		SANDERS	No, I don't think I owe them an apology.
0	552.0		SANDERS	They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.
0	553.0		SANDERS	They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.
0	554.0		CLINTON	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.
0	555.0		CLINTON	This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.
0	556.0		CLINTON	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.
0	557.0		CLINTON	And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.
0	558.0		CLINTON	What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.
0	559.0		CLINTON	New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.
0	560.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	561.0		CLINTON	The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.
0	562.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	563.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
0	564.0		SANDERS	Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.
0	565.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	566.0		BLITZER	Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.
0	567.0		LOUIS	Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.
0	568.0		LOUIS	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.
0	569.0		LOUIS	Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?
0	570.0		CLINTON	Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.
0	571.0		CLINTON	And you mentioned some of them.
0	572.0		CLINTON	The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.
0	573.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	574.0		CLINTON	And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.
0	575.0		CLINTON	So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.
0	576.0		CLINTON	On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.
0	577.0		CLINTON	I think that sentences got much too long.
0	578.0		CLINTON	The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.
0	579.0		CLINTON	So we have a problem.
0	580.0		CLINTON	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.
0	581.0		CLINTON	So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.
0	582.0		CLINTON	So that's how I see it.
0	583.0		CLINTON	And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.
0	584.0		LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary.
0	585.0		CLINTON	To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.
0	586.0		LOUIS	"Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake."""
0	587.0		LOUIS	"Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, ""it's clearly insufficient."""
0	588.0		LOUIS	Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?
0	589.0		CLINTON	Well, look, I supported the crime bill.
0	590.0		CLINTON	My husband has apologized.
0	591.0		CLINTON	He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...
0	592.0		LOUIS	But what about you, Senator?
0	593.0		CLINTON	... voted for it.
0	594.0		CLINTON	I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.
0	595.0		CLINTON	I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.
0	596.0		CLINTON	That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.
0	597.0		CLINTON	And I also want people...
0	598.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	599.0		CLINTON	... especially I want -- I want white people -- I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism.
0	600.0		CLINTON	It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.
0	601.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	602.0		LOUIS	Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.
0	603.0		LOUIS	Why did you call him out?
0	604.0		SANDERS	Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.
0	605.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	606.0		SANDERS	Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right.
0	607.0		SANDERS	We had a crime bill.
0	608.0		SANDERS	I voted for it.
0	609.0		SANDERS	It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.
0	610.0		SANDERS	When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence.
0	611.0		SANDERS	This took us a good step forward.
0	612.0		SANDERS	We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.
0	613.0		SANDERS	This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.
0	614.0		SANDERS	But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.
0	615.0		SANDERS	We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.
0	616.0		SANDERS	And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.
0	617.0		SANDERS	And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this.
0	618.0		SANDERS	The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.
0	619.0		SANDERS	You know what I think?
0	620.0		SANDERS	Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.
0	621.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	622.0		SANDERS	And I'll tell you what else.
0	623.0		SANDERS	And I'll tell you what else I think.
0	624.0		SANDERS	And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it.
0	625.0		SANDERS	We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.
0	626.0		SANDERS	Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.
0	627.0		SANDERS	Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period.
0	628.0		SANDERS	And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.
0	629.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	630.0		LOUIS	Thank you.
0	631.0		LOUIS	Thank you.
0	632.0		LOUIS	Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.
0	633.0		CLINTON	Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.
0	634.0		CLINTON	I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.
0	635.0		CLINTON	And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.
0	636.0		CLINTON	We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.
0	637.0		CLINTON	That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in...
0	638.0		LOUIS	Thank you.
0	639.0		LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	640.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	641.0		CLINTON	... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.
0	642.0		LOUIS	Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.
0	643.0		LOUIS	Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.
0	644.0		LOUIS	So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.
0	645.0		LOUIS	To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners.
0	646.0		LOUIS	How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?
0	647.0		SANDERS	We're going to work with state governments all over this country.
0	648.0		SANDERS	And you know what?
0	649.0		SANDERS	In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.
0	650.0		SANDERS	With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities.
0	651.0		SANDERS	On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support.
0	652.0		SANDERS	We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.
0	653.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	654.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	655.0		BLITZER	We have to take a quick commercial break.
0	656.0		BLITZER	We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.
0	657.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	658.0		BLITZER	Welcome back.
0	659.0		BLITZER	Let's turn to another critically important issue.
0	660.0		BLITZER	Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.
0	661.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.
0	662.0		BLITZER	You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.
0	663.0		BLITZER	What are his lies?
0	664.0		CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.
0	665.0		CLINTON	And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.
0	666.0		CLINTON	But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.
0	667.0		CLINTON	And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.
0	668.0		CLINTON	"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge."
0	669.0		CLINTON	So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.
0	670.0		CLINTON	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.
0	671.0		CLINTON	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.
0	672.0		CLINTON	And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.
0	673.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	674.0		BLITZER	We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.
0	675.0		SANDERS	It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.
0	676.0		SANDERS	I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.
1	677.0		SANDERS	But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.
0	678.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	679.0		SANDERS	Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount.
0	680.0		SANDERS	That's true.
0	681.0		SANDERS	But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.
0	682.0		SANDERS	Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.
0	683.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	684.0		SANDERS	And, it is not good enough.
0	685.0		SANDERS	You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it.
0	686.0		SANDERS	That was what 9/11 was about.
0	687.0		SANDERS	We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances.
0	688.0		SANDERS	There's going to be international conflict.
0	689.0		SANDERS	(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...
0	690.0		BLITZER	....
0	691.0		BLITZER	Thank you...
0	692.0		SANDERS	... Including a tax on carbon.
0	693.0		SANDERS	Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.
0	694.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	695.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.
0	696.0		CLINTON	Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.
0	697.0		CLINTON	Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.
0	698.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	699.0		CLINTON	I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.
0	700.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	701.0		CLINTON	And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough.
0	702.0		CLINTON	You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...
0	703.0		BLITZER	... Thank you...
0	704.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE CHEERING)
0	705.0		CLINTON	... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...
0	706.0		BLITZER	... Go ahead, Senator...
0	707.0		SANDERS	... Let's talk about that.
0	708.0		SANDERS	When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.
0	709.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	710.0		SANDERS	The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there.
0	711.0		SANDERS	We've got to get beyond paper right now.
0	712.0		SANDERS	We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.
0	713.0		SANDERS	(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.
0	714.0		SANDERS	Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land.
0	715.0		SANDERS	That's not Secretary Clinton's position.
0	716.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	717.0		BLITZER	Let us support a tax on carbon...
0	718.0		BLITZER	... Secretary Clinton...
0	719.0		SANDERS	... Not Secretary Clinton's position.
0	720.0		BLITZER	... Go ahead and respond.
0	721.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	722.0		CLINTON	Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.
0	723.0		CLINTON	He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.
0	724.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	725.0		CLINTON	And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.
0	726.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	727.0		CLINTON	Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.
0	728.0		CLINTON	It's harder to do something about the problem.
0	729.0		CLINTON	And...
0	730.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	731.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	732.0		BLITZER	We'll continue on this.
0	733.0		BLITZER	Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.
0	734.0		SANDERS	Wolf.
0	735.0		SANDERS	Wolf.
0	736.0		BLITZER	We're going to continue on this.
0	737.0		BLITZER	Errol, go ahead.
0	738.0		LOUIS	OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described.
0	739.0		LOUIS	Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.
0	740.0		LOUIS	Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.
0	741.0		LOUIS	Why have you changed your view on fracking?
0	742.0		CLINTON	No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.
0	743.0		CLINTON	And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.
0	744.0		CLINTON	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.
0	745.0		CLINTON	We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.
0	746.0		CLINTON	That's why I've set big goals.
0	747.0		CLINTON	I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.
0	748.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	749.0		CLINTON	So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.
0	750.0		LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary.
0	751.0		LOUIS	All right, Senator?
0	752.0		SANDERS	All right, here is -- here is a real difference.
0	753.0		SANDERS	This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.
0	754.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	755.0		SANDERS	Not right now.
0	756.0		SANDERS	Not on climate change.
0	757.0		SANDERS	Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.
0	758.0		SANDERS	Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
0	759.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	760.0		SANDERS	And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.
0	761.0		SANDERS	Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?
0	762.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	763.0		CLINTON	You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.
0	764.0		CLINTON	I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.
0	765.0		CLINTON	I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.
0	766.0		CLINTON	That's exactly what I have proposed.
0	767.0		LOUIS	OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	768.0		CLINTON	And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.
0	769.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	770.0		LOUIS	Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.
0	771.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.
0	772.0		LOUIS	Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...
0	773.0		SANDERS	Are you for a tax on carbon or not?
0	774.0		LOUIS	I have a question for you.
0	775.0		LOUIS	You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.
0	776.0		LOUIS	You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.
0	777.0		LOUIS	You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.
0	778.0		LOUIS	But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?
0	779.0		SANDERS	No, they wouldn't.
0	780.0		SANDERS	Look, here's where we are.
0	781.0		SANDERS	Let me reiterate.
0	782.0		SANDERS	We have a global crisis.
0	783.0		SANDERS	Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.
0	784.0		SANDERS	Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation.
0	785.0		SANDERS	It is absolutely true.
0	786.0		SANDERS	There will be some people who lose their job.
0	787.0		SANDERS	And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.
0	788.0		SANDERS	It is not their fault...
0	789.0		SANDERS	It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.
0	790.0		SANDERS	But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly.
0	791.0		SANDERS	What does that mean?
0	792.0		UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Senator -- senator, jobs...
0	793.0		SANDERS	Yes?
0	794.0		UNIDENTIFIED MALE	-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...
0	795.0		SANDERS	Well, you don't phase...
0	796.0		UNIDENTIFIED MALE	-- that difference?
0	797.0		SANDERS	-- it all out tomorrow.
0	798.0		SANDERS	And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.
0	799.0		SANDERS	But this is what you do do.
0	800.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	801.0		SANDERS	What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.
0	802.0		SANDERS	We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.
0	803.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	804.0		SANDERS	Saving -- rebuilding our rail system.
0	805.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	806.0		SANDERS	Our mass transit system.
0	807.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	808.0		SANDERS	If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.
0	809.0		SANDERS	That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.
0	810.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	811.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	812.0		SANDERS	Lead the world.
0	813.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	814.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	815.0		BLITZER	Let's turn to another critically important issue...
0	816.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	817.0		BLITZER	-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.
0	818.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.
0	819.0		BLITZER	You were his secretary of State.
0	820.0		BLITZER	Aren't you also responsible for that?
0	821.0		CLINTON	Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.
0	822.0		CLINTON	And here's what we did.
0	823.0		CLINTON	We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.
0	824.0		CLINTON	I was very proud of that.
0	825.0		CLINTON	We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.
0	826.0		CLINTON	We also worked to help them set up their government.
0	827.0		CLINTON	We sent a lot of American experts there.
0	828.0		CLINTON	We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.
0	829.0		CLINTON	They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.
0	830.0		CLINTON	And so we were caught in a very difficult position.
0	831.0		CLINTON	They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.
0	832.0		CLINTON	And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.
0	833.0		CLINTON	And we can't walk away from that.
0	834.0		CLINTON	We need to be working with European and Arab partners...
0	835.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	836.0		CLINTON	-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.
0	837.0		CLINTON	The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.
0	838.0		CLINTON	And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them
0	839.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
0	840.0		SANDERS	"According to ""The New York Times."
0	841.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	842.0		SANDERS	for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?
0	843.0		SANDERS	"The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change."
0	844.0		SANDERS	And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.
0	845.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	846.0		SANDERS	Look...
0	847.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	848.0		SANDERS	-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs.
0	849.0		SANDERS	No debate about that.
0	850.0		SANDERS	But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.
0	851.0		SANDERS	Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold.
0	852.0		SANDERS	And I think if you studied the whole history of...
0	853.0		BLITZER	Yes.
0	854.0		SANDERS	-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.
0	855.0		BLITZER	Secretary, we're going to let you respond.
0	856.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	857.0		CLINTON	Yes, well, I...
0	858.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	859.0		CLINTON	-- I...
0	860.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	861.0		CLINTON	-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.
1	862.0		CLINTON	Senator Sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.
0	863.0		SANDERS	No.
0	864.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	865.0		CLINTON	We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did.
0	866.0		CLINTON	We went to the United Nations Security Council.
0	867.0		CLINTON	We got support from the Security Council.
0	868.0		CLINTON	And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.
0	869.0		CLINTON	This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.
0	870.0		CLINTON	And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.
0	871.0		CLINTON	Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.
0	872.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	873.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	874.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
0	875.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.
0	876.0		SANDERS	What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?
1	877.0		SANDERS	Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy.
1	878.0		SANDERS	But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.
0	879.0		SANDERS	Totally different issue.
0	880.0		CLINTON	Well, that isn't...
0	881.0		SANDERS	Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...
0	882.0		BLITZER	Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.
0	883.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Secretary.
0	884.0		CLINTON	There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.
0	885.0		CLINTON	So, yes, it was unanimous.
0	886.0		CLINTON	That's exactly right, including you.
0	887.0		CLINTON	And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.
0	888.0		CLINTON	The decision was the president's.
0	889.0		CLINTON	Did I do the due diligence?
0	890.0		CLINTON	Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?
0	891.0		CLINTON	Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?
0	892.0		CLINTON	Yes, I did.
0	893.0		CLINTON	That's what a secretary of state does.
0	894.0		CLINTON	But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.
0	895.0		CLINTON	And the president made that decision.
0	896.0		CLINTON	And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.
0	897.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	898.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.
0	899.0		SANDERS	If you listen, you know -- two points.
0	900.0		SANDERS	Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.
0	901.0		SANDERS	But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.
0	902.0		SANDERS	Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.
0	903.0		SANDERS	Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.
0	904.0		CLINTON	Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.
0	905.0		CLINTON	Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.
0	906.0		CLINTON	The president said no.
0	907.0		CLINTON	Now, that's how it works.
0	908.0		CLINTON	People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.
0	909.0		CLINTON	So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.
0	910.0		CLINTON	And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.
0	911.0		BLITZER	Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.
0	912.0		BASH	"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."""
0	913.0		BASH	Do you still feel that way?
0	914.0		SANDERS	Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.
0	915.0		SANDERS	Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.
0	916.0		SANDERS	Yes, I do.
0	917.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	918.0		BASH	And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.
0	919.0		BASH	So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?
0	920.0		SANDERS	Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.
0	921.0		SANDERS	All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.
0	922.0		SANDERS	So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.
0	923.0		SANDERS	You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.
0	924.0		SANDERS	Nothing wrong with that.
0	925.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	926.0		BASH	Secretary Clinton?
0	927.0		CLINTON	I support our continuing involvement in NATO.
0	928.0		CLINTON	And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.
0	929.0		CLINTON	There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.
0	930.0		CLINTON	But there's a larger question here.
0	931.0		CLINTON	NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.
0	932.0		CLINTON	It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.
0	933.0		CLINTON	So...
0	934.0		BASH	But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.
0	935.0		BASH	That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.
0	936.0		BASH	If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?
0	937.0		CLINTON	I will stay in NATO.
0	938.0		CLINTON	I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.
0	939.0		CLINTON	Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.
0	940.0		CLINTON	Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.
0	941.0		CLINTON	They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.
0	942.0		CLINTON	That meant a lot.
0	943.0		CLINTON	And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.
0	944.0		CLINTON	With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.
0	945.0		CLINTON	Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.
0	946.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	947.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	948.0		BLITZER	Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel.
0	949.0		BLITZER	"Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life."""
0	950.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	951.0		BLITZER	What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?
0	952.0		SANDERS	Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.
0	953.0		SANDERS	That is not a debate.
0	954.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	955.0		SANDERS	But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that.
0	956.0		SANDERS	Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism.
0	957.0		SANDERS	But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.
0	958.0		AUDIENCE MEMBER	Free Palestine!
0	959.0		SANDERS	Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.
0	960.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	961.0		SANDERS	And, let me say something else.
0	962.0		SANDERS	As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.
0	963.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	964.0		SANDERS	So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%.
0	965.0		SANDERS	You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated.
0	966.0		SANDERS	I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.
0	967.0		SANDERS	That does not make me anti-Israel.
0	968.0		SANDERS	That paves the way, I think...
0	969.0		BLITZER	... Thank you, Senator...
0	970.0		SANDERS	...to an approach that works in the Middle East.
0	971.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	972.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	973.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?
0	974.0		CLINTON	I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.
0	975.0		CLINTON	I did it in concert with...
0	976.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	977.0		CLINTON	President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.
0	978.0		CLINTON	I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.
0	979.0		CLINTON	They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.
0	980.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	981.0		CLINTON	They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.
0	982.0		CLINTON	And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.
0	983.0		CLINTON	So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.
0	984.0		CLINTON	You have a right to defend yourself.
0	985.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	986.0		CLINTON	That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.
0	987.0		CLINTON	And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.
0	988.0		CLINTON	It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...
0	989.0		BLITZER	... Thank you...
0	990.0		CLINTON	... just let me finish.
0	991.0		CLINTON	The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.
0	992.0		CLINTON	And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.
0	993.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	994.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator.
0	995.0		SANDERS	I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.
0	996.0		SANDERS	That is not the issue.
0	997.0		SANDERS	And, you evaded the answer.
0	998.0		SANDERS	You evaded the question.
0	999.0		SANDERS	The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism.
0	1000.0		SANDERS	That's not the debate.
0	1001.0		SANDERS	Was their response disproportionate?
0	1002.0		SANDERS	I believe that it was, you have not answered that.
0	1003.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	1004.0		CLINTON	I will certainly be willing to answer it.
0	1005.0		CLINTON	I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.
0	1006.0		SYSTEM	(AUDIENCE REACTION)
0	1007.0		CLINTON	I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.
0	1008.0		CLINTON	It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza.
0	1009.0		CLINTON	They took out all the Israelis.
0	1010.0		CLINTON	They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.
0	1011.0		CLINTON	And what happened?
0	1012.0		CLINTON	Hamas took over Gaza.
0	1013.0		CLINTON	So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.
0	1014.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1015.0		BLITZER	Senator.
0	1016.0		SANDERS	I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.
0	1017.0		SANDERS	I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.
0	1018.0		SANDERS	Almost none in that speech.
0	1019.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1020.0		SANDERS	So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.
0	1021.0		SANDERS	That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.
0	1022.0		CLINTON	Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.
0	1023.0		CLINTON	And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.
0	1024.0		CLINTON	There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.
0	1025.0		CLINTON	Three long meetings.
0	1026.0		CLINTON	And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.
0	1027.0		CLINTON	I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.
0	1028.0		CLINTON	And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security.
0	1029.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1030.0		BLITZER	A final word, Senator, go ahead.
0	1031.0		SANDERS	There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.
0	1032.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1033.0		CLINTON	Well...
0	1034.0		BLITZER	Secretary.
0	1035.0		CLINTON	... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.
0	1036.0		CLINTON	Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.
0	1037.0		CLINTON	If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.
0	1038.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
1	1039.0		SANDERS	You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.
0	1040.0		SANDERS	And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.
0	1041.0		SANDERS	All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.
0	1042.0		SANDERS	There are two sides to the issue.
0	1043.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	1044.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1045.0		BLITZER	We have to take another quick, quick break.
0	1046.0		BLITZER	But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York.
0	1047.0		BLITZER	That is coming up right after this.
0	1048.0		SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0	1049.0		BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.
0	1050.0		BLITZER	We're here in Brooklyn.
0	1051.0		BLITZER	Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.
0	1052.0		BLITZER	Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges.
0	1053.0		BLITZER	The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt.
0	1054.0		BLITZER	How is this fiscally responsible?
0	1055.0		SANDERS	Well, first of all, I disagree with that study.
0	1056.0		SANDERS	There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.
0	1057.0		SANDERS	For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French.
0	1058.0		SANDERS	My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...
0	1059.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1060.0		SANDERS	... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.
0	1061.0		SANDERS	Public colleges and universities tuition free?
0	1062.0		SANDERS	Damn right.
0	1063.0		SANDERS	That is exactly what we should be doing.
0	1064.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1065.0		SANDERS	And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.
0	1066.0		SANDERS	Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.
0	1067.0		SANDERS	The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.
0	1068.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1069.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	1070.0		BLITZER	Secretary, go ahead and respond.
0	1071.0		CLINTON	Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.
0	1072.0		CLINTON	Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare.
0	1073.0		CLINTON	And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.
0	1074.0		CLINTON	And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.
0	1075.0		CLINTON	We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families.
0	1076.0		CLINTON	There's no doubt about that.
0	1077.0		CLINTON	But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...
0	1078.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1079.0		CLINTON	... are actually going to work.
0	1080.0		CLINTON	And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.
0	1081.0		CLINTON	He changed in the middle of this campaign.
0	1082.0		CLINTON	He put out another plan.
0	1083.0		CLINTON	People have been analyzing the new plan.
0	1084.0		CLINTON	And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.
0	1085.0		CLINTON	In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor.
0	1086.0		CLINTON	A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.
0	1087.0		CLINTON	The same for free college.
0	1088.0		CLINTON	The free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.
0	1089.0		CLINTON	You read the fine print, and here's what it says.
0	1090.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1091.0		CLINTON	The fine print says this, that it will -- the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...
0	1092.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
0	1093.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1094.0		CLINTON	... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.
0	1095.0		SANDERS	I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.
0	1096.0		BLITZER	Secretary please.
0	1097.0		SANDERS	We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.
0	1098.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1099.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.
0	1100.0		SANDERS	I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know?
0	1101.0		SANDERS	It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country.
0	1102.0		SANDERS	They're doing OK.
0	1103.0		SANDERS	They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people.
0	1104.0		SANDERS	We can do the same.
0	1105.0		SANDERS	In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing.
0	1106.0		SANDERS	Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime?
0	1107.0		SANDERS	For trying to get an education.
0	1108.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	1109.0		SANDERS	So, yes, we are going to pay for it...
0	1110.0		CLINTON	Well...
0	1111.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, go ahead.
0	1112.0		CLINTON	We have -- we have a difference of opinion.
0	1113.0		CLINTON	We both want to get to universal health care coverage.
0	1114.0		CLINTON	I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.
0	1115.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1116.0		CLINTON	And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.
0	1117.0		CLINTON	So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...
0	1118.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1119.0		CLINTON	... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.
0	1120.0		BLITZER	Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue.
0	1121.0		BLITZER	Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits.
0	1122.0		BLITZER	Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500?
0	1123.0		BLITZER	Yes or no, would you lift the cap?
0	1124.0		CLINTON	I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
0	1125.0		CLINTON	That is one way.
0	1126.0		CLINTON	If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.
0	1127.0		CLINTON	But there are other ways.
0	1128.0		CLINTON	We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.
0	1129.0		CLINTON	We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.
0	1130.0		CLINTON	But here's the real issue, because I -- I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.
0	1131.0		CLINTON	I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.
0	1132.0		CLINTON	I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.
0	1133.0		CLINTON	But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.
0	1134.0		CLINTON	And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.
0	1135.0		CLINTON	And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...
0	1136.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1137.0		CLINTON	-- system and that will be my highest priority.
0	1138.0		BLITZER	Senator?
0	1139.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.
0	1140.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1141.0		SANDERS	An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.
0	1142.0		CLINTON	I did.
0	1143.0		CLINTON	If that's the way we're...
0	1144.0		SANDERS	No, you didn't.
0	1145.0		SANDERS	My legi...
0	1146.0		CLINTON	-- yes, I did.
0	1147.0		SANDERS	Can I answer...
0	1148.0		CLINTON	I did answer the...
0	1149.0		SANDERS	-- may I please...
0	1150.0		CLINTON	Well, don't -- don't put words...
0	1151.0		SANDERS	-- can I have... (CROSSTALK)
0	1152.0		CLINTON	-- into my mouth and say something...
0	1153.0		SANDERS	-- do I not?
0	1154.0		CLINTON	-- that's not accurate.
0	1155.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.
0	1156.0		SANDERS	All right.
0	1157.0		SANDERS	Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)...
0	1158.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1159.0		SANDERS	Now, we've got -- here is the issue.
0	1160.0		SANDERS	Your answer has been the same year after year.
0	1161.0		SANDERS	In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea.
0	1162.0		SANDERS	It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea.
0	1163.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1164.0		SANDERS	He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up.
0	1165.0		SANDERS	If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0	1166.0		SANDERS	You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.
0	1167.0		SANDERS	What's wrong with that?
0	1168.0		SANDERS	Are you prepared to support it?
0	1169.0		CLINTON	I have supported it.
0	1170.0		CLINTON	You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.
0	1171.0		SANDERS	You have sup...
0	1172.0		CLINTON	I think it's important...
0	1173.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1174.0		CLINTON	-- to point out that...
0	1175.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1176.0		CLINTON	-- you know, we're -- we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
0	1177.0		CLINTON	Think about what the other side wants to do.
0	1178.0		CLINTON	They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.
0	1179.0		CLINTON	They still want to privatize it.
0	1180.0		CLINTON	In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.
0	1181.0		SANDERS	All right, so...
0	1182.0		CLINTON	So, yes, we both want to make sure...

0	1195.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)

0	1197.0		SANDERS	If that is the case, welcome on board.
0	1198.0		SANDERS	I'm glad you're here.
0	1199.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)

0	1208.0		CLINTON	-- we are going...
0	1209.0		LOUIS	Secretary...
0	1210.0		CLINTON	I -- as he said, I've said the same thing for years.
0	1211.0		CLINTON	I didn't say anything different tonight.
0	1212.0		CLINTON	We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
0	1213.0		CLINTON	There is still something called Congress.
0	1214.0		CLINTON	Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate...
0	1215.0		BLITZER	Errol...
0	1216.0		CLINTON	-- so a lot of -- a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented...
0	1217.0		BLITZER	Errol, hold on a second.
0	1218.0		CLINTON	-- when I am president.
0	1219.0		LOUIS	Secretary...
0	1220.0		BLITZER	Go ahead.
0	1221.0		BLITZER	Hold on, Errol...
0	1222.0		SANDERS	-- I'm still...
0	1223.0		BLITZER	-- Errol.
0	1224.0		BLITZER	Hold on.
0	1225.0		SANDERS	I've got to admit...
0	1226.0		BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.
0	1227.0		SANDERS	-- maybe I'm a little bit confused.
0	1228.0		SANDERS	Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...
0	1229.0		CLINTON	I am...
0	1230.0		SANDERS	-- yes or no?
0	1231.0		CLINTON	I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination...
0	1232.0		SANDERS	Oh, you -- ah.
0	1233.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1234.0		SYSTEM	(BOOS)
0	1235.0		SANDERS	OK.
0	1236.0		CLINTON	-- or combination of ways...
0	1237.0		SYSTEM	(BOOS)
0	1238.0		CLINTON	-- you know...
0	1239.0		SYSTEM	(BOOS)
0	1240.0		CLINTON	-- it -- it's all -- it's always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment.
0	1241.0		CLINTON	Well, let me say then...
0	1242.0		SANDERS	Well, look...
0	1243.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1244.0		CLINTON	-- let me say this...
0	1245.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1246.0		CLINTON	-- we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.
0	1247.0		CLINTON	We've got some good ideas to do it.
0	1248.0		CLINTON	Let's get a Congress elected...
0	1249.0		BLITZER	Thank you.
0	1250.0		CLINTON	-- that will actually agree...
0	1251.0		BLITZER	Well, thank you...
0	1252.0		CLINTON	-- with us in doing it.
0	1253.0		BLITZER	Errol, go ahead.
0	1254.0		LOUIS	OK, Secretary Clinton, I've got a question for you from a reader...
0	1255.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1256.0		SANDERS	Let me interject here.
0	1257.0		LOUIS	"-- of the ""New York Daily News."""
0	1258.0		SANDERS	Yes, Secretary Clinton...
0	1259.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1260.0		SANDERS	-- you are a member of the establishment.
0	1261.0		LOUIS	-- this was a reader...
0	1262.0		SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).
0	1263.0		LOUIS	"-- of ""The Daily News"" who sent us a..."
0	1264.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	1265.0		LOUIS	-- a question for you.
0	1266.0		LOUIS	Just a second, Senator.
0	1267.0		LOUIS	Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court.
0	1268.0		LOUIS	President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election.
0	1269.0		LOUIS	If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?
0	1270.0		CLINTON	I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this.
0	1271.0		CLINTON	And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals.
0	1272.0		CLINTON	I fully support the president.
0	1273.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1274.0		CLINTON	And I believe that the president -- the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history.
0	1275.0		CLINTON	And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond.
0	1276.0		CLINTON	So I'm going to support the president.
0	1277.0		CLINTON	When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.
0	1278.0		LOUIS	Senator Sanders.
0	1279.0		SANDERS	Well, there is no question.
0	1280.0		SANDERS	I mean, it really is an outrage.
0	1281.0		SANDERS	And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.
0	1282.0		SANDERS	I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court.
0	1283.0		SANDERS	Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.
0	1284.0		LOUIS	So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?
0	1285.0		SANDERS	Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate.
0	1286.0		SANDERS	But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think -- I think this.
0	1287.0		SANDERS	I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.
0	1288.0		(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.
0	1289.0		(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.
0	1290.0		(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth.
0	1291.0		(APPLAUSE) CLINTON	We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.
0	1292.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1293.0		CLINTON	And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights.
0	1294.0		CLINTON	We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.
0	1295.0		CLINTON	And we are never asked about this.
0	1296.0		CLINTON	And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction.
0	1297.0		CLINTON	I don't think it's a distraction.
0	1298.0		CLINTON	It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.
0	1299.0		BASH	Senator Sanders, your response.
0	1300.0		SANDERS	You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so.
0	1301.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1302.0		BASH	Thank you, Senator.
0	1303.0		SANDERS	Who not only thinks we are not going to -- not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.
0	1304.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1305.0		BASH	Senator Sanders, you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress.
0	1306.0		BASH	You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat.
0	1307.0		BASH	Now you're seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat.
0	1308.0		BASH	Are you?
0	1309.0		SANDERS	Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States?
0	1310.0		(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	But here is a good point.
0	1311.0		(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.
0	1312.0		(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points.
0	1313.0		(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	And you know why?
0	1314.0		(APPLAUSE) SANDERS	Because in fact a whole lot of people -- this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.
0	1315.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1316.0		BASH	Senator Sanders...
0	1317.0		SANDERS	And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes.
0	1318.0		SANDERS	We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.
0	1319.0		BASH	Senator Sanders.
0	1320.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1321.0		SANDERS	I am in this race as a Democrat.
0	1322.0		SANDERS	I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected.
0	1323.0		SANDERS	I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign.
0	1324.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	1325.0		BASH	On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times.
0	1326.0		BASH	She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year.
0	1327.0		BASH	You don't appear to have raised any money for the party.
0	1328.0		BASH	Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you.
0	1329.0		BASH	Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?
0	1330.0		SANDERS	The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC.
0	1331.0		SANDERS	I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.
0	1332.0		SANDERS	But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.
0	1333.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1334.0		SANDERS	And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors.
0	1335.0		SANDERS	I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...
0	1336.0		BASH	... Thank you Senator.
0	1337.0		SANDERS	$27 a contribution...
0	1338.0		BASH	... Senator, your time is up...
0	1339.0		BASH	SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see.
0	1340.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	1341.0		BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
0	1342.0		BASH	Secretary Clinton.
0	1343.0		CLINTON	Let us talk about where we are in this race.
0	1344.0		CLINTON	I've gotten more votes than anybody running.
0	1345.0		CLINTON	9.6 million at the last count.
0	1346.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	1347.0		CLINTON	That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.
0	1348.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1349.0		CLINTON	And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.
0	1350.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	1351.0		CLINTON	I think you have to look at the facts.
0	1352.0		CLINTON	And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running.
0	1353.0		CLINTON	It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating.
0	1354.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	1355.0		BASH	Thank you, Madam Secretary.
0	1356.0		BASH	Senator Sanders.
0	1357.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
0	1358.0		CLINTON	And, I want to say -- I also want to say that I do -- I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.
0	1359.0		CLINTON	I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.
0	1360.0		CLINTON	We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.
0	1361.0		CLINTON	But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...
0	1362.0		BASH	... Secretary Clinton, thank you.
0	1363.0		CLINTON	And, I know something about that...
0	1364.0		BASH	... Secretary Clinton...
0	1365.0		CLINTON	Thank you so much.
0	1366.0		CLINTON	Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama...
0	1367.0		BASH	...Secretary Clinton, you're out of time...
0	1368.0		CLINTON	... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president...
0	1369.0		BASH	...Senator Sanders, on that note....
0	1370.0		SANDERS	... Let me, if I may just briefly say something...
0	1371.0		BASH	... Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response.
0	1372.0		BASH	Three months now between now and the Democratic convention.
0	1373.0		BASH	Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone.
0	1374.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1375.0		BASH	Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?
0	1376.0		SANDERS	I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth.
0	1377.0		SYSTEM	(CHEERING)
0	1378.0		SANDERS	Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true.
1	1379.0		SANDERS	Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South.
0	1380.0		SANDERS	No question about it.
0	1381.0		SANDERS	We got murdered there.
0	1382.0		SANDERS	That is the most conservative part of this great country.
0	1383.0		SANDERS	That's the fact.
0	1384.0		SANDERS	But you know what?
0	1385.0		SANDERS	We're out of the Deep South now.
0	1386.0		SANDERS	And we're moving up.
0	1387.0		SANDERS	We got here.
0	1388.0		SANDERS	We're going to California.
0	1389.0		SANDERS	We got a number of large states there.
0	1390.0		SANDERS	And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.
0	1391.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1392.0		CLINTON	Now, let me say this...
0	1393.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, go ahead.
0	1394.0		CLINTON	I think it's -- I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.
0	1395.0		CLINTON	And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.
0	1396.0		CLINTON	And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.
0	1397.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1398.0		CLINTON	And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.
0	1399.0		CLINTON	I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.
0	1400.0		CLINTON	So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.
0	1401.0		CLINTON	I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.
0	1402.0		CLINTON	And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...
0	1403.0		BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.
0	1404.0		CLINTON	... that we'll go onto the general election with.
0	1405.0		SANDERS	The reason -- the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people -- and I'm not just talking about very young.
0	1406.0		SANDERS	You know, the older you get, the younger young gets -- 45 or younger -- is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face.
0	1407.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1408.0		SANDERS	And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests.
0	1409.0		SANDERS	So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...
0	1410.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.
0	1411.0		SANDERS	... many of whom previously had given up.
0	1412.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Senator, very much.
0	1413.0		BLITZER	The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this.
0	1414.0		BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.
0	1415.0		BLITZER	It's time for the candidates' closing statements.
0	1416.0		BLITZER	Each candidate will have two minutes.
0	1417.0		BLITZER	Senator Sanders, you're first.
0	1418.0		SANDERS	I grew up in Brooklyn, New York...
0	1419.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1420.0		SANDERS	... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.
0	1421.0		SANDERS	I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life.
0	1422.0		SANDERS	And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country.
0	1423.0		SANDERS	I just don't accept that.
0	1424.0		SANDERS	What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.
0	1425.0		SANDERS	And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.
0	1426.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1427.0		SANDERS	That is what the political revolution is about.
0	1428.0		SANDERS	That is what this campaign is about.
0	1429.0		SANDERS	And with your help, we're going to win here in New York.
0	1430.0		SANDERS	Thank you.
0	1431.0		SANDERS	Thank you.
0	1432.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1433.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?
0	1434.0		BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?
0	1435.0		CLINTON	Thank you.
0	1436.0		CLINTON	I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator.
0	1437.0		CLINTON	You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006.
0	1438.0		CLINTON	During those years, we worked closely together.
0	1439.0		CLINTON	I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine.
0	1440.0		CLINTON	We took on the challenges of 9/11 together.
0	1441.0		CLINTON	We got the money to rebuild New York.
0	1442.0		CLINTON	We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.
0	1443.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1444.0		CLINTON	We worked to create jobs -- despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush -- across New York.
0	1445.0		CLINTON	And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.
0	1446.0		CLINTON	I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.
0	1447.0		CLINTON	You know, of course we have economic barriers.
0	1448.0		CLINTON	I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life.
0	1449.0		CLINTON	But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.
0	1450.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1451.0		CLINTON	We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.
0	1452.0		CLINTON	So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.
0	1453.0		CLINTON	I'll work my heart out for you again.
0	1454.0		CLINTON	And together, we won't just make promises we can't keep.
0	1455.0		CLINTON	We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.
0	1456.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1457.0		CLINTON	That's what we'll do together.
0	1458.0		CLINTON	Thank you, New York.
0	1459.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1460.0		BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1461.0		BLITZER	Thank you very much, Senator.
0	1462.0		BLITZER	I want to thank the candidates for a really terrific debate.
0	1463.0		BLITZER	Thanks also to Dana Bash and Errol Louis, as well as NY1, the Democratic National Committee, and everyone here at the Duggal Greenhouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
0	1464.0		BLITZER	Stay with CNN now for complete coverage of the New York primary next Tuesday.
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you, thank you.
0	2.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	3.0		TRUMP	Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
0	4.0		TRUMP	USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
0	5.0		TRUMP	Who would have believed that when we started this journey because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago.
0	6.0		TRUMP	Who would have believed this.
0	7.0		TRUMP	Who would have believed this.
0	8.0		TRUMP	The Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago.
0	9.0		TRUMP	Not so good.
0	10.0		TRUMP	Not so good.
0	11.0		TRUMP	Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.
0	12.0		TRUMP	We will be a country of generosity and warmth.
0	13.0		TRUMP	But we will also be a country of law and order.
0	14.0		TRUMP	Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.
0	15.0		TRUMP	The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life.
0	16.0		TRUMP	Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
0	17.0		TRUMP	Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.
0	18.0		TRUMP	Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.
0	19.0		TRUMP	I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.
0	20.0		TRUMP	Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.
0	21.0		TRUMP	The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
0	22.0		TRUMP	Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.
0	23.0		TRUMP	It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.
0	24.0		TRUMP	I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
0	25.0		TRUMP	We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.
0	26.0		TRUMP	So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.
0	27.0		TRUMP	Go there.
0	28.0		TRUMP	But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.
0	29.0		TRUMP	We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
1	30.0		TRUMP	These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.
1	31.0		TRUMP	Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities.
1	32.0		TRUMP	That's the largest increase in 25 years.
1	33.0		TRUMP	In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.
1	34.0		TRUMP	They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.
0	35.0		TRUMP	In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone.
0	36.0		TRUMP	And more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.
0	37.0		TRUMP	The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.
0	38.0		TRUMP	Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.
0	39.0		TRUMP	The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.
0	40.0		TRUMP	They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.
0	41.0		TRUMP	One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
0	42.0		TRUMP	There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.
0	43.0		TRUMP	She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.
0	44.0		TRUMP	Number one in her class.
0	45.0		TRUMP	Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.
0	46.0		TRUMP	I've met Sarah's beautiful family.
0	47.0		TRUMP	But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting.
0	48.0		TRUMP	No more.
0	49.0		TRUMP	One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.
0	50.0		TRUMP	What about our economy?
0	51.0		TRUMP	Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed.
0	52.0		TRUMP	2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
0	53.0		TRUMP	Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.
1	54.0		TRUMP	Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.
0	55.0		TRUMP	That's sixteen years ago.
1	56.0		TRUMP	Our trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone.
0	57.0		TRUMP	We're going to fix that.
0	58.0		TRUMP	The budget is no better.
0	59.0		TRUMP	President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.
0	60.0		TRUMP	And yet, what do we have to show for it?
0	61.0		TRUMP	Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.
0	62.0		TRUMP	Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.
0	63.0		TRUMP	Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another.
0	64.0		TRUMP	One after another.
0	65.0		TRUMP	We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.
1	66.0		TRUMP	This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.
0	67.0		TRUMP	Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.
0	68.0		TRUMP	In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.
0	69.0		TRUMP	America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.
0	70.0		TRUMP	Let's defeat her in November, okay?
0	71.0		TRUMP	I am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets.
0	72.0		TRUMP	Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today.
0	73.0		TRUMP	Let's review the record.
0	74.0		TRUMP	In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.
0	75.0		TRUMP	Libya was stable.
0	76.0		TRUMP	Egypt was peaceful.
0	77.0		TRUMP	Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence.
0	78.0		TRUMP	Iran was being choked by sanctions.
0	79.0		TRUMP	Syria was somewhat under control.
0	80.0		TRUMP	After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?
0	81.0		TRUMP	ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world.
0	82.0		TRUMP	Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.
1	83.0		TRUMP	Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.
0	84.0		TRUMP	Iraq is in chaos.
1	85.0		TRUMP	Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.
0	86.0		TRUMP	Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West.
0	87.0		TRUMP	After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.
0	88.0		TRUMP	This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.
0	89.0		TRUMP	But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.
0	90.0		TRUMP	The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.
0	91.0		TRUMP	A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.
0	92.0		TRUMP	Tonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America.
0	93.0		TRUMP	The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.
0	94.0		TRUMP	Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
0	95.0		TRUMP	As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.
0	96.0		TRUMP	The respect that we deserve.
0	97.0		TRUMP	The American People will come first once again.
0	98.0		TRUMP	My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism.
0	99.0		TRUMP	There can be no prosperity without law and order.
0	100.0		TRUMP	On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.
0	101.0		TRUMP	A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.
0	102.0		TRUMP	That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.
0	103.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	104.0		TRUMP	It's for their benefit.
0	105.0		TRUMP	Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.
0	106.0		TRUMP	They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does.
0	107.0		TRUMP	She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.
0	108.0		TRUMP	That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change.
0	109.0		TRUMP	Never ever.
0	110.0		TRUMP	My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.
0	111.0		TRUMP	Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.
0	112.0		TRUMP	I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.
0	113.0		TRUMP	These are the forgotten men and women of our country.
0	114.0		TRUMP	And they are forgotten.
0	115.0		TRUMP	But they're not going to be forgotten long.
0	116.0		TRUMP	These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice.
0	117.0		TRUMP	I am your voice.
0	118.0		TRUMP	I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
0	119.0		TRUMP	I have no patience for injustice.
0	120.0		TRUMP	How great are our police!
0	121.0		TRUMP	And how great is Cleveland?
0	122.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	123.0		TRUMP	I have no patience for injustice.
0	124.0		TRUMP	No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.
0	125.0		TRUMP	When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.
0	126.0		TRUMP	And I won't look the other way.
1	127.0		TRUMP	And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.
0	128.0		TRUMP	"When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did."
0	129.0		TRUMP	They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.
0	130.0		TRUMP	In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly.
0	131.0		TRUMP	When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.
0	132.0		TRUMP	I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.
0	133.0		TRUMP	Nobody knows the system better than me.
0	134.0		TRUMP	Which is why I alone can fix it.
0	135.0		TRUMP	I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.
0	136.0		TRUMP	Never had a chance.
0	137.0		TRUMP	But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.
0	138.0		TRUMP	Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans.
0	139.0		TRUMP	In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.
0	140.0		TRUMP	And a great guy.
0	141.0		TRUMP	We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.
0	142.0		TRUMP	Which is amazing.
0	143.0		TRUMP	He's a man of character and accomplishment.
0	144.0		TRUMP	He's the man for the job.
0	145.0		TRUMP	The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community.
0	146.0		TRUMP	America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed.
0	147.0		TRUMP	Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.
0	148.0		TRUMP	Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.
0	149.0		TRUMP	On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
0	150.0		TRUMP	Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured.
0	151.0		TRUMP	An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.
0	152.0		TRUMP	I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.
0	153.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	154.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	155.0		TRUMP	I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.
0	156.0		TRUMP	In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.
0	157.0		TRUMP	The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.
0	158.0		TRUMP	This Administration has failed America's inner cities.
0	159.0		TRUMP	Remember, it has failed America's inner cities.
0	160.0		TRUMP	It's failed them on education.
0	161.0		TRUMP	It's failed them on jobs.
0	162.0		TRUMP	It's failed them on crime.
0	163.0		TRUMP	It's failed them in every way and at every single level.
0	164.0		TRUMP	When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.
0	165.0		TRUMP	Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?
0	166.0		TRUMP	Any other child.
0	167.0		TRUMP	To make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country.
0	168.0		TRUMP	We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast.
0	169.0		TRUMP	Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.
0	170.0		TRUMP	Men, women and children viciously mowed down.
0	171.0		TRUMP	Lives ruined.
0	172.0		TRUMP	Families ripped apart.
0	173.0		TRUMP	A nation in mourning.
0	174.0		TRUMP	The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
0	175.0		TRUMP	And many many other locations.
0	176.0		TRUMP	Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist.
0	177.0		TRUMP	This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community.
0	178.0		TRUMP	No good, and we're going to stop it.
0	179.0		TRUMP	As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.
0	180.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	181.0		TRUMP	And I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.
0	182.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	183.0		TRUMP	To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.
0	184.0		TRUMP	We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world.
0	185.0		TRUMP	The best.
0	186.0		TRUMP	We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria.
0	187.0		TRUMP	Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly.
0	188.0		TRUMP	We're going to win.
0	189.0		TRUMP	We're going to win fast.
0	190.0		TRUMP	This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.
0	191.0		TRUMP	Recently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror.
0	192.0		TRUMP	And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share.
0	193.0		TRUMP	As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs.
0	194.0		TRUMP	Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism.
0	195.0		TRUMP	A true step in the right direction.
0	196.0		TRUMP	Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.
0	197.0		TRUMP	We don't want them in our country.
1	198.0		TRUMP	My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this.
0	199.0		TRUMP	Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening.
1	200.0		TRUMP	A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.
1	201.0		TRUMP	She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.
0	202.0		TRUMP	I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.
0	203.0		TRUMP	Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.
0	204.0		TRUMP	Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.
0	205.0		TRUMP	We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.
0	206.0		TRUMP	On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw.
0	207.0		TRUMP	They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly.
0	208.0		TRUMP	Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve.
0	209.0		TRUMP	We have to solve it.
0	210.0		TRUMP	These families have no special interests to represent them.
0	211.0		TRUMP	There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf.
0	212.0		TRUMP	My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.
0	213.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	214.0		TRUMP	Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.
0	215.0		TRUMP	But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
0	216.0		TRUMP	Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel?
0	217.0		TRUMP	Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly.
0	218.0		TRUMP	Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?
0	219.0		TRUMP	These wounded American families have been alone.
0	220.0		TRUMP	But they are not alone any longer.
0	221.0		TRUMP	Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.
0	222.0		TRUMP	<br>We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.
0	223.0		TRUMP	I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.
0	224.0		TRUMP	And will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system.
0	225.0		TRUMP	Lawful.
0	226.0		TRUMP	By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence.
0	227.0		TRUMP	Illegal border crossings will go down.
0	228.0		TRUMP	We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore.
0	229.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	230.0		TRUMP	Peace will be restored.
0	231.0		TRUMP	By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve.
0	232.0		TRUMP	Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say.
0	233.0		TRUMP	On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.
0	234.0		TRUMP	We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.
0	235.0		TRUMP	But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
0	236.0		TRUMP	USA.
0	237.0		TRUMP	USA.
0	238.0		TRUMP	USA.
0	239.0		TRUMP	My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.
0	240.0		TRUMP	Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.
0	241.0		TRUMP	Which is what we have now.
0	242.0		TRUMP	Communities want relief.
0	243.0		TRUMP	Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.
0	244.0		TRUMP	Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.
0	245.0		TRUMP	I have a different vision for our workers.
0	246.0		TRUMP	It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.
0	247.0		TRUMP	Of which there are many.
0	248.0		TRUMP	It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.
0	249.0		TRUMP	I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again.
0	250.0		TRUMP	Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.
0	251.0		TRUMP	America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
1	252.0		TRUMP	Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.
0	253.0		TRUMP	Or frankly, any other country.
0	254.0		TRUMP	Never ever again.
0	255.0		TRUMP	I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence.
0	256.0		TRUMP	Not going to happen anymore.
0	257.0		TRUMP	My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.
0	258.0		TRUMP	She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.
0	259.0		TRUMP	She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea.
0	260.0		TRUMP	She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
0	261.0		TRUMP	Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.
0	262.0		TRUMP	And it's not going to happen.
0	263.0		TRUMP	I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence.
0	264.0		TRUMP	We will never sign bad trade deals.
0	265.0		TRUMP	America First again.
0	266.0		TRUMP	America First.
0	267.0		TRUMP	Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.
0	268.0		TRUMP	No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.
0	269.0		TRUMP	We are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats.
0	270.0		TRUMP	This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.
0	271.0		TRUMP	They are the greatest that ever came about.
0	272.0		TRUMP	They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.
0	273.0		TRUMP	Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated.
0	274.0		TRUMP	That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal.
0	275.0		TRUMP	Our country is going to start building and making things again.
0	276.0		TRUMP	Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.
1	277.0		TRUMP	While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.
1	278.0		TRUMP	While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.
1	279.0		TRUMP	Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone.
0	280.0		TRUMP	I mean everyone.
1	281.0		TRUMP	America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.
0	282.0		TRUMP	Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.
0	283.0		TRUMP	Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.
0	284.0		TRUMP	Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all.
1	285.0		TRUMP	Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly.
0	286.0		TRUMP	We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
0	287.0		TRUMP	This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.
0	288.0		TRUMP	My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president.
0	289.0		TRUMP	Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.
0	290.0		TRUMP	With these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.
0	291.0		TRUMP	This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.
0	292.0		TRUMP	This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs.
0	293.0		TRUMP	We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.
0	294.0		TRUMP	My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children.
0	295.0		TRUMP	And that's what she's doing.
0	296.0		TRUMP	And that's what's she's done.
0	297.0		TRUMP	We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
1	298.0		TRUMP	You will be able to choose your own doctor again.
0	299.0		TRUMP	And we will fix TSA at the airports!
0	300.0		TRUMP	Which is a total disaster.
0	301.0		TRUMP	We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives.
0	302.0		TRUMP	Tremendous problem.
0	303.0		TRUMP	We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.
0	304.0		TRUMP	We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.
0	305.0		TRUMP	My just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support.
0	306.0		TRUMP	We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying.
0	307.0		TRUMP	My opponent dismissed the VA scandal.
0	308.0		TRUMP	One more sign of how out of touch she really is.
0	309.0		TRUMP	We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
0	310.0		TRUMP	The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.
0	311.0		TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
0	312.0		TRUMP	The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies.
0	313.0		TRUMP	Very important.
0	314.0		TRUMP	This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.
0	315.0		TRUMP	My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.
0	316.0		TRUMP	I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.
0	317.0		TRUMP	At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what.
0	318.0		TRUMP	Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing.
0	319.0		TRUMP	And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight.
0	320.0		TRUMP	True.
0	321.0		TRUMP	So true.
0	322.0		TRUMP	They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.
0	323.0		TRUMP	An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.
0	324.0		TRUMP	Their voice has been taken away.
0	325.0		TRUMP	I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.
0	326.0		TRUMP	We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.
0	327.0		TRUMP	Start believing.
0	328.0		TRUMP	It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.
0	329.0		TRUMP	In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.
0	330.0		TRUMP	And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job.
0	331.0		TRUMP	My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew.
0	332.0		TRUMP	I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight.
0	333.0		TRUMP	It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.
0	334.0		TRUMP	He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.
0	335.0		TRUMP	I love those people.
0	336.0		TRUMP	Then there's my mother, Mary.
0	337.0		TRUMP	She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded.
0	338.0		TRUMP	She was a truly great mother.
0	339.0		TRUMP	She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character.
0	340.0		TRUMP	She could pick 'em out from anywhere.
0	341.0		TRUMP	To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.
0	342.0		TRUMP	I have had a truly great life in business.
0	343.0		TRUMP	But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for you.
0	344.0		TRUMP	It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.
0	345.0		TRUMP	We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again.
0	346.0		TRUMP	But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.
0	347.0		TRUMP	America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.
0	348.0		TRUMP	Remember: all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn't stand, I mean they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight.
0	349.0		TRUMP	Not a chance.
0	350.0		TRUMP	The same people.
0	351.0		TRUMP	Oh we love defeating those people.
0	352.0		TRUMP	Don't we?
0	353.0		TRUMP	Don't we?
0	354.0		TRUMP	Love it.
0	355.0		TRUMP	Love it.
0	356.0		TRUMP	Love it.
0	357.0		TRUMP	No longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.
0	358.0		TRUMP	Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.
0	359.0		TRUMP	History is watching us now.
0	360.0		TRUMP	We don't have much time, but history is watching.
0	361.0		TRUMP	It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.
0	362.0		TRUMP	I am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House.
0	363.0		TRUMP	And I will be your champion.
0	364.0		TRUMP	My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge.
0	365.0		TRUMP	"It reads: ""I'm With Her""."
0	366.0		TRUMP	I choose to recite a different pledge.
0	367.0		TRUMP	"My pledge reads: ""I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."""
0	368.0		TRUMP	I am your voice.
0	369.0		TRUMP	So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
0	370.0		TRUMP	To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.
0	371.0		TRUMP	We Will Make America Proud Again.
0	372.0		TRUMP	We Will Make America Safe Again.
0	373.0		TRUMP	And We Will Make America Great Again.
0	374.0		TRUMP	God bless you, and goodnight.
0	375.0		TRUMP	I love you.
0	1.0		HOLT	Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.
0	2.0		HOLT	"I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."""
0	3.0		HOLT	I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.
0	4.0		HOLT	The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
0	5.0		HOLT	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.
0	6.0		HOLT	The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.
0	7.0		HOLT	The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.
0	8.0		HOLT	We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.
0	9.0		HOLT	At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.
0	10.0		HOLT	From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.
0	11.0		HOLT	The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.
0	12.0		HOLT	The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.
0	13.0		HOLT	I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
0	14.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	15.0		CLINTON	How are you, Donald?
0	16.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	17.0		HOLT	Good luck to you.
0	18.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	19.0		HOLT	Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.
0	20.0		HOLT	We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.
0	21.0		HOLT	I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.
0	22.0		HOLT	Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.
0	23.0		HOLT	So, let's begin.
0	24.0		HOLT	"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."""
0	25.0		HOLT	And central to that is jobs.
0	26.0		HOLT	There are two economic realities in America today.
0	27.0		HOLT	There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.
0	28.0		HOLT	However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
0	29.0		HOLT	Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?
0	30.0		CLINTON	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.
0	31.0		CLINTON	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
0	32.0		CLINTON	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.
0	33.0		CLINTON	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
0	34.0		CLINTON	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
0	35.0		CLINTON	I want us to invest in you.
0	36.0		CLINTON	I want us to invest in your future.
0	37.0		CLINTON	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.
0	38.0		CLINTON	We also have to make the economy fairer.
0	39.0		CLINTON	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.
0	40.0		CLINTON	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.
0	41.0		CLINTON	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.
0	42.0		CLINTON	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.
0	43.0		CLINTON	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.
0	44.0		CLINTON	So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.
0	45.0		CLINTON	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.
0	46.0		CLINTON	How are we going to do it?
0	47.0		CLINTON	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.
0	48.0		CLINTON	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.
0	49.0		CLINTON	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.
0	50.0		CLINTON	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.
0	51.0		CLINTON	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.
0	52.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
0	53.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, the same question to you.
0	54.0		HOLT	It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.
0	55.0		HOLT	You have up to two minutes.
0	56.0		TRUMP	Thank you, Lester.
0	57.0		TRUMP	Our jobs are fleeing the country.
0	58.0		TRUMP	They're going to Mexico.
0	59.0		TRUMP	They're going to many other countries.
0	60.0		TRUMP	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.
0	61.0		TRUMP	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.
0	62.0		TRUMP	And we have a very good fight.
0	63.0		TRUMP	And we have a winning fight.
0	64.0		TRUMP	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.
0	65.0		TRUMP	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.
0	66.0		TRUMP	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.
0	67.0		TRUMP	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.
0	68.0		TRUMP	With the United States, as he said, not so much.
1	69.0		TRUMP	So Ford is leaving.
1	70.0		TRUMP	You see that, their small car division leaving.
1	71.0		TRUMP	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.
0	72.0		TRUMP	They're all leaving.
0	73.0		TRUMP	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.
0	74.0		TRUMP	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.
0	75.0		TRUMP	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.
0	76.0		TRUMP	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.
0	77.0		TRUMP	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.
0	78.0		TRUMP	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.
0	79.0		TRUMP	They left -- fired 1,400 people.
0	80.0		TRUMP	They're going to Mexico.
0	81.0		TRUMP	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.
0	82.0		TRUMP	We cannot let it happen.
0	83.0		TRUMP	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.
0	84.0		TRUMP	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.
0	85.0		TRUMP	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
0	86.0		TRUMP	Companies will come.
0	87.0		TRUMP	They will build.
0	88.0		TRUMP	They will expand.
0	89.0		TRUMP	New companies will start.
0	90.0		TRUMP	And I look very, very much forward to doing it.
0	91.0		TRUMP	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.
0	92.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?
0	93.0		CLINTON	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.
0	94.0		CLINTON	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.
0	95.0		CLINTON	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.
0	96.0		CLINTON	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.
0	97.0		CLINTON	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.
0	98.0		CLINTON	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.
0	99.0		CLINTON	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.
0	100.0		CLINTON	That is not how we grow the economy.
0	101.0		CLINTON	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.
0	102.0		CLINTON	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.
0	103.0		CLINTON	I understand that.
0	104.0		CLINTON	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.
1	105.0		CLINTON	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.
0	106.0		CLINTON	I don't buy that.
0	107.0		CLINTON	I have a different experience.
0	108.0		CLINTON	My father was a small-businessman.
0	109.0		CLINTON	He worked really hard.
0	110.0		CLINTON	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.
0	111.0		CLINTON	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.
0	112.0		CLINTON	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.
0	113.0		HOLT	Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.
0	114.0		HOLT	You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.
0	115.0		HOLT	How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?
0	116.0		HOLT	How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?
1	117.0		TRUMP	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
0	118.0		TRUMP	Our country's in deep trouble.
0	119.0		TRUMP	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.
0	120.0		TRUMP	They're the best, the best ever at it.
0	121.0		TRUMP	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.
0	122.0		TRUMP	So we have to do that.
0	123.0		TRUMP	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.
0	124.0		TRUMP	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.
0	125.0		TRUMP	Let me give you the example of Mexico.
0	126.0		TRUMP	They have a VAT tax.
0	127.0		TRUMP	We're on a different system.
0	128.0		TRUMP	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.
0	129.0		TRUMP	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.
0	130.0		TRUMP	When they sell into us, there's no tax.
0	131.0		TRUMP	It's a defective agreement.
0	132.0		TRUMP	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.
0	133.0		TRUMP	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?
0	134.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	135.0		TRUMP	I want you to be very happy.
0	136.0		TRUMP	It's very important to me.
0	137.0		TRUMP	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.
0	138.0		TRUMP	She's been doing this for 30 years.
0	139.0		TRUMP	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?
0	140.0		TRUMP	The NAFTA agreement is defective.
0	141.0		TRUMP	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...
0	142.0		HOLT	Let me interrupt just a moment, but...
0	143.0		TRUMP	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.
0	144.0		TRUMP	They should have been doing this for years.
0	145.0		TRUMP	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.
0	146.0		TRUMP	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.
0	147.0		HOLT	Back to the question, though.
0	148.0		HOLT	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?
0	149.0		HOLT	How do you make them bring the jobs back?
0	150.0		TRUMP	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.
0	151.0		TRUMP	The companies are leaving.
0	152.0		TRUMP	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.
0	153.0		TRUMP	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.
0	154.0		TRUMP	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.
0	155.0		TRUMP	We wish you a lot of luck.
0	156.0		TRUMP	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.
0	157.0		TRUMP	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.
0	158.0		TRUMP	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.
0	159.0		TRUMP	We have to stop them from leaving.
0	160.0		TRUMP	And that's a big, big factor.
0	161.0		HOLT	Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.
0	162.0		CLINTON	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.
0	163.0		CLINTON	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.
0	164.0		CLINTON	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.
0	165.0		CLINTON	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.
0	166.0		CLINTON	"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""
0	167.0		CLINTON	Well, it did collapse.
0	168.0		TRUMP	That's called business, by the way.
0	169.0		CLINTON	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.
0	170.0		CLINTON	Five million people lost their homes.
0	171.0		CLINTON	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
0	172.0		CLINTON	Now, we have come back from that abyss.
0	173.0		CLINTON	And it has not been easy.
0	174.0		CLINTON	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.
1	175.0		CLINTON	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.
1	176.0		CLINTON	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.
0	177.0		CLINTON	Take clean energy.
0	178.0		CLINTON	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.
1	179.0		CLINTON	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
0	180.0		CLINTON	I think it's real.
0	181.0		TRUMP	I did not.
0	182.0		TRUMP	I did not.
0	183.0		TRUMP	I do not say that.
0	184.0		CLINTON	I think science is real.
0	185.0		TRUMP	I do not say that.
0	186.0		CLINTON	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.
0	187.0		CLINTON	And here's what we can do.
0	188.0		CLINTON	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.
0	189.0		CLINTON	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.
0	190.0		CLINTON	We can build a new modern electric grid.
0	191.0		CLINTON	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.
0	192.0		CLINTON	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.
0	193.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump?
0	194.0		TRUMP	She talks about solar panels.
0	195.0		TRUMP	We invested in a solar company, our country.
0	196.0		TRUMP	That was a disaster.
0	197.0		TRUMP	They lost plenty of money on that one.
0	198.0		TRUMP	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.
0	199.0		TRUMP	Our energy policies are a disaster.
0	200.0		TRUMP	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.
0	201.0		TRUMP	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.
0	202.0		TRUMP	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.
0	203.0		TRUMP	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.
0	204.0		TRUMP	So I will tell you this.
0	205.0		TRUMP	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.
0	206.0		TRUMP	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.
0	207.0		TRUMP	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.
0	208.0		TRUMP	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.
0	209.0		TRUMP	You've been doing this for 30 years.
0	210.0		TRUMP	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?
0	211.0		TRUMP	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.
0	212.0		CLINTON	Well, actually...
0	213.0		TRUMP	I will bring -- excuse me.
0	214.0		TRUMP	I will bring back jobs.
0	215.0		TRUMP	You can't bring back jobs.
0	216.0		CLINTON	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.
0	217.0		TRUMP	Yeah, for 30 years.
0	218.0		CLINTON	And I have -- well, not quite that long.
0	219.0		CLINTON	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.
0	220.0		CLINTON	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...
1	221.0		TRUMP	Well, he approved NAFTA...
0	222.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	223.0		CLINTON	million new jobs, a balanced budget...
1	224.0		TRUMP	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.
0	225.0		CLINTON	Incomes went up for everybody.
0	226.0		CLINTON	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.
0	227.0		CLINTON	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.
0	228.0		CLINTON	Will they create jobs in America?
0	229.0		CLINTON	Will they raise incomes in America?
0	230.0		CLINTON	And are they good for our national security?
0	231.0		CLINTON	Some of them I voted for.
0	232.0		CLINTON	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.
0	233.0		CLINTON	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.
0	234.0		CLINTON	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.
0	235.0		CLINTON	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.
0	236.0		CLINTON	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.
0	237.0		CLINTON	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.
0	238.0		CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.
0	239.0		CLINTON	We increased them to China 50 percent.
0	240.0		CLINTON	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.
0	241.0		HOLT	Very quickly...
0	242.0		TRUMP	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...
0	243.0		CLINTON	Well, I've been a senator, Donald...
0	244.0		TRUMP	You haven't done it.
0	245.0		TRUMP	You haven't done it.
0	246.0		CLINTON	And I have been a secretary of state...
0	247.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	248.0		CLINTON	And I have done a lot...
1	249.0		TRUMP	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.
0	250.0		CLINTON	Well, that's your opinion.
0	251.0		CLINTON	That is your opinion.
0	252.0		TRUMP	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.
0	253.0		TRUMP	NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.
0	254.0		TRUMP	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.
0	255.0		TRUMP	You were totally in favor of it.
0	256.0		TRUMP	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.
0	257.0		TRUMP	But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
0	258.0		TRUMP	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.
0	259.0		CLINTON	Well, that is just not accurate.
0	260.0		CLINTON	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.
0	261.0		CLINTON	I wrote about that in...
1	262.0		TRUMP	You called it the gold standard.
0	263.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1	264.0		TRUMP	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.
1	265.0		TRUMP	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
0	266.0		CLINTON	No.
0	267.0		TRUMP	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.
0	268.0		CLINTON	Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.
0	269.0		CLINTON	The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...
0	270.0		TRUMP	Not.
0	271.0		CLINTON	which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.
0	272.0		CLINTON	I wrote about that in my book...
0	273.0		TRUMP	So is it President Obama's fault?
0	274.0		CLINTON	before you even announced.
0	275.0		TRUMP	Is it President Obama's fault?
0	276.0		CLINTON	Look, there are differences...
0	277.0		TRUMP	Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?
0	278.0		CLINTON	There are...
0	279.0		TRUMP	Because he's pushing it.
0	280.0		CLINTON	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.
0	281.0		CLINTON	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.
0	282.0		CLINTON	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.
0	283.0		TRUMP	But you have no plan.
0	284.0		CLINTON	But in -- oh, but I do.
0	285.0		TRUMP	Secretary, you have no plan.
0	286.0		CLINTON	In fact, I have written a book about it.
0	287.0		CLINTON	"It's called ""Stronger Together."""
0	288.0		CLINTON	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...
0	289.0		TRUMP	That's about all you've...
0	290.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	291.0		HOLT	Folks, we're going to...
0	292.0		CLINTON	or at an airport near you.
0	293.0		HOLT	We're going to move to...
0	294.0		CLINTON	But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.
0	295.0		CLINTON	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.
0	296.0		CLINTON	So we have a very robust set of plans.
0	297.0		CLINTON	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.
0	298.0		TRUMP	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.
0	299.0		TRUMP	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.
0	300.0		TRUMP	You are going to drive business out.
0	301.0		TRUMP	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.
0	302.0		TRUMP	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.
0	303.0		TRUMP	I'm very proud of it.
0	304.0		TRUMP	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.
0	305.0		TRUMP	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.
0	306.0		TRUMP	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.
0	307.0		TRUMP	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.
0	308.0		TRUMP	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.
0	309.0		TRUMP	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.
0	310.0		TRUMP	I'm going to cut regulations.
0	311.0		TRUMP	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.
0	312.0		HOLT	Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment.
0	313.0		HOLT	We're going to talk taxes...
0	314.0		CLINTON	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.
0	315.0		HOLT	Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.
0	316.0		CLINTON	I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...
0	317.0		TRUMP	Facts.
0	318.0		CLINTON	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.
0	319.0		CLINTON	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.
0	320.0		CLINTON	Because what I have proposed...
0	321.0		TRUMP	And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.
0	322.0		CLINTON	would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.
0	323.0		CLINTON	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.
0	324.0		CLINTON	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.
0	325.0		CLINTON	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.
0	326.0		HOLT	Well, you just opened the next segment.
0	327.0		TRUMP	Well, could I just finish -- I think I...
0	328.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	329.0		HOLT	I'm going to give you a chance right here...
0	330.0		TRUMP	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.
0	331.0		HOLT	with a new 15-minute segment...
0	332.0		TRUMP	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.
0	333.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, I'm going to...
0	334.0		TRUMP	And look at her website.
0	335.0		TRUMP	You know what?
0	336.0		TRUMP	It's no difference than this.
0	337.0		TRUMP	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.
0	338.0		TRUMP	Just go to her website.
0	339.0		TRUMP	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.
0	340.0		TRUMP	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.
0	341.0		HOLT	The next segment, we're continuing...
0	342.0		CLINTON	Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.
0	343.0		HOLT	achieving prosperity...
0	344.0		TRUMP	No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.
0	345.0		CLINTON	No, we're not.
0	346.0		CLINTON	No, we're not.
0	347.0		TRUMP	See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.
0	348.0		TRUMP	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.
0	349.0		CLINTON	That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.
0	350.0		HOLT	OK, you are unpacking a lot here.
0	351.0		HOLT	And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.
0	352.0		HOLT	And I want to talk about taxes.
0	353.0		HOLT	The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.
0	354.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.
0	355.0		HOLT	I'd like you to further defend that.
0	356.0		HOLT	And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.
0	357.0		HOLT	I'd like you to defend that.
0	358.0		HOLT	And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.
0	359.0		TRUMP	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.
0	360.0		TRUMP	They're going to expand their companies.
0	361.0		TRUMP	They're going to do a tremendous job.
0	362.0		TRUMP	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.
0	363.0		TRUMP	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.
0	364.0		TRUMP	It's a great thing for the middle class.
0	365.0		TRUMP	It's a great thing for companies to expand.
0	366.0		TRUMP	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.
0	367.0		TRUMP	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.
0	368.0		TRUMP	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.
0	369.0		TRUMP	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.
0	370.0		TRUMP	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.
0	371.0		TRUMP	And here's the thing.
0	372.0		TRUMP	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.
0	373.0		TRUMP	I happen to think it's double that.
0	374.0		TRUMP	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.
0	375.0		TRUMP	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.
0	376.0		TRUMP	But we have no leadership.
0	377.0		TRUMP	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.
0	378.0		HOLT	All right.
0	379.0		HOLT	You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.
0	380.0		CLINTON	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.
0	381.0		TRUMP	Why not?
0	382.0		CLINTON	Why not?
0	383.0		CLINTON	Yeah, why not?
0	384.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	385.0		CLINTON	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.
0	386.0		CLINTON	Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...
0	387.0		TRUMP	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.
0	388.0		HOLT	This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.
0	389.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	390.0		CLINTON	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.
0	391.0		CLINTON	We've looked at your tax proposals.
0	392.0		CLINTON	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.
0	393.0		CLINTON	I happen to support that.
0	394.0		TRUMP	Then you didn't read it.
0	395.0		CLINTON	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.
0	396.0		CLINTON	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.
0	397.0		CLINTON	You've proposed an approach that has a...
0	398.0		TRUMP	Who gave it that name?
0	399.0		TRUMP	The first I've -- who gave it that name?
0	400.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	401.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.
0	402.0		CLINTON	$4 billion tax benefit for your family.
0	403.0		CLINTON	And when you look at what you are proposing...
0	404.0		TRUMP	How much?
0	405.0		TRUMP	How much for my family?
0	406.0		CLINTON	it is...
0	407.0		TRUMP	Lester, how much?
0	408.0		CLINTON	as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.
0	409.0		CLINTON	Trickle-down did not work.
0	410.0		CLINTON	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.
0	411.0		CLINTON	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.
0	412.0		CLINTON	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.
0	413.0		CLINTON	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.
0	414.0		CLINTON	I don't think top-down works in America.
0	415.0		CLINTON	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.
0	416.0		CLINTON	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.
0	417.0		CLINTON	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.
0	418.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, we're...
0	419.0		TRUMP	Typical politician.
0	420.0		TRUMP	All talk, no action.
0	421.0		TRUMP	Sounds good, doesn't work.
0	422.0		TRUMP	Never going to happen.
0	423.0		TRUMP	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.
0	424.0		TRUMP	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.
0	425.0		TRUMP	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.
0	426.0		TRUMP	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.
0	427.0		TRUMP	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.
0	428.0		TRUMP	And we better be awfully careful.
0	429.0		TRUMP	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.
0	430.0		TRUMP	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.
0	431.0		TRUMP	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.
0	432.0		TRUMP	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.
0	433.0		TRUMP	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.
0	434.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.
0	435.0		HOLT	And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.
0	436.0		HOLT	Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?
0	437.0		TRUMP	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.
0	438.0		TRUMP	And it'll be released.
0	439.0		TRUMP	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.
0	440.0		TRUMP	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.
0	441.0		TRUMP	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.
0	442.0		TRUMP	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.
0	443.0		TRUMP	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
1	444.0		TRUMP	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.
0	445.0		TRUMP	You know what that is?
0	446.0		TRUMP	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?
0	447.0		TRUMP	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.
0	448.0		HOLT	The IRS says an audit...
0	449.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	450.0		HOLT	of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.
0	451.0		HOLT	And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...
0	452.0		TRUMP	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.
0	453.0		TRUMP	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.
0	454.0		TRUMP	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.
0	455.0		TRUMP	I said, do you get audited?
0	456.0		TRUMP	I get audited almost every year.
0	457.0		TRUMP	And in a way, I should be complaining.
0	458.0		TRUMP	I'm not even complaining.
0	459.0		TRUMP	I don't mind it.
0	460.0		TRUMP	It's almost become a way of life.
0	461.0		TRUMP	I get audited by the IRS.
0	462.0		TRUMP	But other people don't.
0	463.0		TRUMP	I will say this.
0	464.0		TRUMP	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.
0	465.0		TRUMP	I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.
0	466.0		TRUMP	As soon as she releases them, I will release.
0	467.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	468.0		TRUMP	I will release my tax returns.
0	469.0		TRUMP	"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""
0	470.0		TRUMP	I will tell you this.
0	471.0		TRUMP	No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.
0	472.0		TRUMP	Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.
0	473.0		TRUMP	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.
0	474.0		TRUMP	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.
0	475.0		HOLT	So it's negotiable?
0	476.0		TRUMP	It's not negotiable, no.
0	477.0		TRUMP	Let her release the e-mails.
0	478.0		TRUMP	Why did she delete 33,000...
0	479.0		HOLT	Well, I'll let her answer that.
0	480.0		HOLT	But let me just admonish the audience one more time.
0	481.0		HOLT	There was an agreement.
0	482.0		HOLT	We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.
0	483.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	484.0		CLINTON	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.
0	485.0		CLINTON	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.
0	486.0		CLINTON	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.
0	487.0		CLINTON	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.
0	488.0		CLINTON	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?
0	489.0		CLINTON	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.
0	490.0		CLINTON	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.
0	491.0		CLINTON	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.
0	492.0		CLINTON	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.
1	493.0		CLINTON	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.
0	494.0		TRUMP	That makes me smart.
0	495.0		CLINTON	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.
0	496.0		CLINTON	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.
0	497.0		CLINTON	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.
0	498.0		CLINTON	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.
0	499.0		CLINTON	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.
0	500.0		CLINTON	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.
0	501.0		CLINTON	And we'll guess.
0	502.0		CLINTON	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.
0	503.0		CLINTON	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?
0	504.0		CLINTON	Who does he owe money to?
0	505.0		CLINTON	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.
0	506.0		HOLT	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.
0	507.0		HOLT	Do you want to respond to that?
0	508.0		CLINTON	I do.
0	509.0		CLINTON	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.
0	510.0		TRUMP	That's for sure.
0	511.0		CLINTON	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.
0	512.0		CLINTON	But I'm not going to make any excuses.
0	513.0		CLINTON	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.
0	514.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump?
0	515.0		TRUMP	That was more than a mistake.
0	516.0		TRUMP	That was done purposely.
0	517.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	518.0		TRUMP	That was not a mistake.
0	519.0		TRUMP	That was done purposely.
0	520.0		TRUMP	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.
0	521.0		TRUMP	And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.
1	522.0		TRUMP	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.
0	523.0		TRUMP	That I can tell you.
0	524.0		TRUMP	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.
0	525.0		TRUMP	And you should go down and take a look at that.
0	526.0		TRUMP	The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.
0	527.0		TRUMP	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.
0	528.0		TRUMP	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.
0	529.0		TRUMP	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.
0	530.0		TRUMP	And the $650 isn't even on that.
0	531.0		TRUMP	But it's not $650.
0	532.0		TRUMP	It's much less than that.
0	533.0		TRUMP	But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.
0	534.0		TRUMP	These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.
0	535.0		TRUMP	I could do that very quickly.
0	536.0		TRUMP	I am very underleveraged.
0	537.0		TRUMP	I have a great company.
0	538.0		TRUMP	I have a tremendous income.
0	539.0		TRUMP	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.
0	540.0		TRUMP	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.
0	541.0		TRUMP	When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.
0	542.0		TRUMP	Our airports are like from a third world country.
0	543.0		TRUMP	You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.
0	544.0		TRUMP	So the worst of all things has happened.
0	545.0		TRUMP	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.
0	546.0		TRUMP	We haven't even started.
0	547.0		TRUMP	And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.
0	548.0		TRUMP	Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.
0	549.0		TRUMP	And it's really a shame.
0	550.0		TRUMP	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.
0	551.0		TRUMP	Our country has tremendous problems.
0	552.0		TRUMP	We're a debtor nation.
0	553.0		TRUMP	We're a serious debtor nation.
0	554.0		TRUMP	And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.
0	555.0		TRUMP	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.
0	556.0		HOLT	We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.
0	557.0		CLINTON	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.
0	558.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	559.0		CLINTON	And the other thing I think is important...
0	560.0		TRUMP	It would be squandered, too, believe me.
0	561.0		CLINTON	is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.
0	562.0		CLINTON	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.
0	563.0		CLINTON	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.
0	564.0		CLINTON	I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.
0	565.0		CLINTON	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.
0	566.0		CLINTON	It's a beautiful facility.
0	567.0		CLINTON	It immediately was put to use.
0	568.0		CLINTON	And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...
0	569.0		TRUMP	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...
0	570.0		CLINTON	Well, to...
0	571.0		TRUMP	Which our country should do, too.
0	572.0		CLINTON	Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?
0	573.0		CLINTON	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.
0	574.0		CLINTON	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.
1	575.0		CLINTON	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.
0	576.0		CLINTON	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.
0	577.0		CLINTON	You call yourself the King of Debt.
0	578.0		CLINTON	You talk about leverage.
0	579.0		CLINTON	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.
0	580.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	581.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	582.0		CLINTON	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.
0	583.0		HOLT	Let's let Mr. Trump...
0	584.0		CLINTON	And we need to be very clear about that.
0	585.0		TRUMP	So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.
0	586.0		TRUMP	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.
0	587.0		TRUMP	I built an unbelievable company.
0	588.0		TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.
0	589.0		TRUMP	It's an unbelievable company.
1	590.0		TRUMP	But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.
0	591.0		TRUMP	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.
0	592.0		TRUMP	Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.
0	593.0		TRUMP	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.
0	594.0		TRUMP	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.
0	595.0		TRUMP	And that's what I do.
0	596.0		TRUMP	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.
0	597.0		TRUMP	I'll give you an example.
0	598.0		TRUMP	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.
0	599.0		TRUMP	But we're opening the Old Post Office.
0	600.0		TRUMP	Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.
0	601.0		TRUMP	I'm a year ahead of schedule.
0	602.0		TRUMP	And that's what this country should be doing.
0	603.0		TRUMP	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.
0	604.0		TRUMP	We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.
0	605.0		TRUMP	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.
0	606.0		TRUMP	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.
0	607.0		TRUMP	And we should be able to do that for our country.
0	608.0		HOLT	Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.
0	609.0		HOLT	We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.
0	610.0		HOLT	And let's start by talking about race.
0	611.0		HOLT	The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.
0	612.0		HOLT	Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.
0	613.0		HOLT	So how do you heal the divide?
0	614.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.
0	615.0		CLINTON	Well, you're right.
0	616.0		CLINTON	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.
0	617.0		CLINTON	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.
0	618.0		CLINTON	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.
0	619.0		CLINTON	And we've got to do several things at the same time.
0	620.0		CLINTON	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.
0	621.0		CLINTON	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.
0	622.0		CLINTON	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.
0	623.0		CLINTON	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.
0	624.0		CLINTON	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.
0	625.0		CLINTON	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.
0	626.0		CLINTON	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.
0	627.0		CLINTON	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.
0	628.0		CLINTON	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.
0	629.0		CLINTON	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.
0	630.0		CLINTON	So we have to do two things, as I said.
0	631.0		CLINTON	We have to restore trust.
0	632.0		CLINTON	We have to work with the police.
0	633.0		CLINTON	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.
0	634.0		CLINTON	And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.
0	635.0		HOLT	All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
0	636.0		HOLT	How do you heal the divide?
0	637.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.
0	638.0		TRUMP	And we need law and order.
0	639.0		TRUMP	If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.
0	640.0		TRUMP	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.
0	641.0		TRUMP	I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.
0	642.0		TRUMP	We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.
0	643.0		TRUMP	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.
0	644.0		TRUMP	You walk down the street, you get shot.
0	645.0		TRUMP	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.
0	646.0		TRUMP	Thousands of shootings.
0	647.0		TRUMP	And I'm saying, where is this?
0	648.0		TRUMP	Is this a war-torn country?
0	649.0		TRUMP	What are we doing?
0	650.0		TRUMP	And we have to stop the violence.
0	651.0		TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.
1	652.0		TRUMP	In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.
0	653.0		TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.
0	654.0		TRUMP	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.
0	655.0		TRUMP	It brought the crime rate way down.
0	656.0		TRUMP	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.
0	657.0		TRUMP	We have gangs roaming the street.
0	658.0		TRUMP	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.
0	659.0		TRUMP	And they have guns.
0	660.0		TRUMP	And they shoot people.
0	661.0		TRUMP	And we have to be very strong.
0	662.0		TRUMP	And we have to be very vigilant.
0	663.0		TRUMP	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.
0	664.0		TRUMP	Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.
0	665.0		TRUMP	We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.
0	666.0		HOLT	Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.
1	667.0		HOLT	Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.
0	668.0		TRUMP	No, you're wrong.
0	669.0		TRUMP	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.
0	670.0		TRUMP	It was taken away from her.
0	671.0		TRUMP	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.
0	672.0		TRUMP	They would have won an appeal.
0	673.0		TRUMP	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.
0	674.0		HOLT	The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.
0	675.0		TRUMP	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.
0	676.0		TRUMP	These are felons.
0	677.0		TRUMP	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.
0	678.0		TRUMP	You need more police.
0	679.0		TRUMP	You need a better community, you know, relation.
0	680.0		TRUMP	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.
0	681.0		TRUMP	It's terrible.
0	682.0		TRUMP	I have property there.
0	683.0		TRUMP	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.
0	684.0		TRUMP	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.
0	685.0		TRUMP	You need better relationships.
0	686.0		TRUMP	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.
0	687.0		TRUMP	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.
0	688.0		TRUMP	But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.
0	689.0		TRUMP	So there's some bad things going on.
0	690.0		TRUMP	Some really bad things.
0	691.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton...
0	692.0		TRUMP	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.
0	693.0		TRUMP	And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.
0	694.0		TRUMP	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.
0	695.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	696.0		CLINTON	Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.
0	697.0		TRUMP	Ugh.
0	698.0		CLINTON	You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.
0	699.0		CLINTON	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.
0	700.0		CLINTON	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.
0	701.0		CLINTON	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.
1	702.0		CLINTON	Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.
0	703.0		CLINTON	It did not do what it needed to do.
0	704.0		CLINTON	Now, I believe in community policing.
0	705.0		CLINTON	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.
0	706.0		CLINTON	Property crime is down 40 percent.
0	707.0		CLINTON	We just don't want to see it creep back up.
0	708.0		CLINTON	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.
0	709.0		CLINTON	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.
0	710.0		CLINTON	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.
0	711.0		CLINTON	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.
0	712.0		CLINTON	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.
0	713.0		CLINTON	We cannot just say law and order.
0	714.0		CLINTON	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.
0	715.0		CLINTON	We need to have more second chance programs.
0	716.0		CLINTON	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.
0	717.0		CLINTON	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.
0	718.0		CLINTON	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.
0	719.0		CLINTON	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.
0	720.0		CLINTON	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.
0	721.0		CLINTON	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.
0	722.0		CLINTON	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.
0	723.0		CLINTON	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.
0	724.0		CLINTON	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.
0	725.0		CLINTON	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.
0	726.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.
0	727.0		HOLT	Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?
0	728.0		CLINTON	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.
0	729.0		CLINTON	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.
0	730.0		CLINTON	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?
0	731.0		CLINTON	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.
0	732.0		CLINTON	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.
0	733.0		CLINTON	They admit it's an issue.
0	734.0		CLINTON	They've got a lot of concerns.
0	735.0		CLINTON	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.
0	736.0		CLINTON	They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.
0	737.0		CLINTON	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.
0	738.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump...
0	739.0		TRUMP	I'd like to respond to that.
0	740.0		HOLT	Please.
0	741.0		TRUMP	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.
0	742.0		TRUMP	I agree with you.
0	743.0		TRUMP	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.
0	744.0		TRUMP	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.
0	745.0		TRUMP	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.
0	746.0		TRUMP	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.
0	747.0		TRUMP	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.
0	748.0		TRUMP	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.
0	749.0		TRUMP	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.
0	750.0		TRUMP	I think you've apologized for it.
0	751.0		TRUMP	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.
0	752.0		TRUMP	And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.
0	753.0		TRUMP	Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.
0	754.0		TRUMP	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.
0	755.0		TRUMP	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.
0	756.0		TRUMP	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.
0	757.0		TRUMP	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?
0	758.0		TRUMP	But we went from 2,200 to 500.
0	759.0		TRUMP	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.
0	760.0		TRUMP	And it was terminated by current mayor.
0	761.0		TRUMP	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.
0	762.0		TRUMP	Tremendous beyond belief.
0	763.0		TRUMP	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.
0	764.0		TRUMP	It had a very, very big impact.
1	765.0		CLINTON	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.
0	766.0		CLINTON	So there is...
0	767.0		TRUMP	No, you're wrong.
0	768.0		TRUMP	You're wrong.
0	769.0		CLINTON	No, I'm not.
1	770.0		TRUMP	Murders are up.
0	771.0		TRUMP	All right.
0	772.0		TRUMP	You check it.
0	773.0		CLINTON	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.
0	774.0		CLINTON	And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.
0	775.0		CLINTON	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.
0	776.0		CLINTON	Look, one murder is too many.
0	777.0		CLINTON	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.
0	778.0		CLINTON	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.
0	779.0		CLINTON	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?
0	780.0		CLINTON	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.
0	781.0		CLINTON	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.
0	782.0		HOLT	This conversation is about race.
0	783.0		HOLT	And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...
0	784.0		TRUMP	I'd like to just respond, if I might.
0	785.0		HOLT	Please -- 20 seconds.
0	786.0		TRUMP	I'd just like to respond.
0	787.0		HOLT	Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.
0	788.0		TRUMP	I will.
0	789.0		TRUMP	Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.
0	790.0		TRUMP	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.
0	791.0		TRUMP	The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.
0	792.0		TRUMP	They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.
0	793.0		TRUMP	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.
0	794.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, let me...
0	795.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	796.0		CLINTON	Well, I -- I do think...
0	797.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.
0	798.0		TRUMP	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.
0	799.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you, I've been all over.
0	800.0		TRUMP	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.
0	801.0		TRUMP	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.
0	802.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, I...
0	803.0		CLINTON	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.
0	804.0		CLINTON	And, yes, I did.
0	805.0		CLINTON	And you know what else I prepared for?
0	806.0		CLINTON	I prepared to be president.
0	807.0		CLINTON	And I think that's a good thing.
0	808.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	809.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.
0	810.0		HOLT	You questioned his legitimacy.
0	811.0		HOLT	In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.
0	812.0		HOLT	Can you tell us what took you so long?
0	813.0		TRUMP	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.
0	814.0		TRUMP	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.
0	815.0		TRUMP	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.
0	816.0		TRUMP	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.
1	817.0		TRUMP	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.
1	818.0		TRUMP	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.
0	819.0		TRUMP	They were pressing it very hard.
0	820.0		TRUMP	She failed to get the birth certificate.
0	821.0		TRUMP	When I got involved, I didn't fail.
0	822.0		TRUMP	I got him to give the birth certificate.
0	823.0		TRUMP	So I'm satisfied with it.
0	824.0		TRUMP	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.
0	825.0		HOLT	That was...
0	826.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	827.0		TRUMP	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.
0	828.0		HOLT	I will let you respond.
0	829.0		HOLT	It's important.
0	830.0		HOLT	But I just want to get the answer here.
0	831.0		HOLT	The birth certificate was produced in 2011.
0	832.0		HOLT	You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...
0	833.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	834.0		HOLT	as recently as January.
0	835.0		HOLT	So the question is, what changed your mind?
0	836.0		TRUMP	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.
0	837.0		TRUMP	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.
0	838.0		TRUMP	But nobody was caring much about it.
0	839.0		TRUMP	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.
0	840.0		TRUMP	And I think I did a good job.
0	841.0		TRUMP	Secretary Clinton also fought it.
0	842.0		TRUMP	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.
0	843.0		TRUMP	Look, it's true.
1	844.0		TRUMP	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.
0	845.0		TRUMP	And she was involved.
0	846.0		TRUMP	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.
0	847.0		HOLT	I'm sorry.
0	848.0		HOLT	I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.
0	849.0		HOLT	But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.
0	850.0		HOLT	What do you say to Americans, people of color who...
0	851.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	852.0		TRUMP	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.
0	853.0		TRUMP	I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.
0	854.0		TRUMP	He should have produced it a long time before.
0	855.0		TRUMP	I say nothing.
0	856.0		TRUMP	But let me just tell you.
0	857.0		TRUMP	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.
0	858.0		TRUMP	I think you can see that.
0	859.0		TRUMP	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.
0	860.0		TRUMP	And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.
0	861.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	862.0		CLINTON	Well, just listen to what you heard.
0	863.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	864.0		CLINTON	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.
0	865.0		CLINTON	But it can't be dismissed that easily.
0	866.0		CLINTON	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.
0	867.0		CLINTON	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.
0	868.0		CLINTON	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.
0	869.0		CLINTON	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.
0	870.0		CLINTON	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.
0	871.0		CLINTON	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.
0	872.0		CLINTON	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.
0	873.0		CLINTON	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.
0	874.0		CLINTON	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.
0	875.0		CLINTON	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.
0	876.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.
0	877.0		TRUMP	I would love to respond.
0	878.0		TRUMP	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.
0	879.0		TRUMP	You treated him with terrible disrespect.
0	880.0		TRUMP	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.
0	881.0		TRUMP	It doesn't work that way.
0	882.0		TRUMP	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.
0	883.0		TRUMP	I don't think you can deny that.
0	884.0		TRUMP	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.
0	885.0		TRUMP	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.
0	886.0		TRUMP	It really doesn't.
0	887.0		TRUMP	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.
0	888.0		TRUMP	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.
0	889.0		TRUMP	It was very easy to do.
0	890.0		TRUMP	I notice you bring that up a lot.
0	891.0		TRUMP	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.
0	892.0		TRUMP	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.
0	893.0		TRUMP	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?
0	894.0		TRUMP	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.
0	895.0		TRUMP	I'll go one step further.
0	896.0		TRUMP	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.
0	897.0		TRUMP	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.
0	898.0		TRUMP	And it's a tremendously successful club.
0	899.0		TRUMP	And I'm so glad I did it.
0	900.0		TRUMP	And I have been given great credit for what I did.
0	901.0		TRUMP	And I'm very, very proud of it.
0	902.0		TRUMP	And that's the way I feel.
0	903.0		TRUMP	That is the true way I feel.
0	904.0		HOLT	"Our next segment is called ""Securing America."""
0	905.0		HOLT	We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.
0	906.0		HOLT	Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.
0	907.0		HOLT	So my question is, who's behind it?
0	908.0		HOLT	And how do we fight it?
0	909.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.
0	910.0		CLINTON	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.
0	911.0		CLINTON	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.
0	912.0		CLINTON	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.
0	913.0		CLINTON	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.
0	914.0		CLINTON	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.
0	915.0		CLINTON	I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...
0	916.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	917.0		CLINTON	tough, long game here.
0	918.0		CLINTON	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.
0	919.0		CLINTON	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.
0	920.0		CLINTON	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.
0	921.0		CLINTON	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.
0	922.0		CLINTON	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.
0	923.0		CLINTON	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.
0	924.0		CLINTON	But we will defend the citizens of this country.
0	925.0		CLINTON	And the Russians need to understand that.
0	926.0		CLINTON	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.
0	927.0		CLINTON	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.
0	928.0		CLINTON	That is just unacceptable.
0	929.0		CLINTON	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...
0	930.0		HOLT	Your two minutes have expired.
0	931.0		CLINTON	have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.
0	932.0		CLINTON	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.
0	933.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.
0	934.0		HOLT	Who's behind it?
0	935.0		HOLT	And how do we fight it?
0	936.0		TRUMP	I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.
0	937.0		TRUMP	That just happened, and many more are coming.
0	938.0		TRUMP	And I'm very proud of it.
0	939.0		TRUMP	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.
0	940.0		TRUMP	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.
0	941.0		TRUMP	I was just endorsed by ICE.
0	942.0		TRUMP	I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.
0	943.0		TRUMP	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.
0	944.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	945.0		TRUMP	Because look at the mess that we're in.
0	946.0		TRUMP	Look at the mess that we're in.
0	947.0		TRUMP	As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.
0	948.0		TRUMP	We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.
0	949.0		TRUMP	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.
0	950.0		TRUMP	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.
0	951.0		TRUMP	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.
0	952.0		TRUMP	It could also be lots of other people.
0	953.0		TRUMP	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?
0	954.0		TRUMP	You don't know who broke in to DNC.
0	955.0		TRUMP	But what did we learn with DNC?
0	956.0		TRUMP	We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
0	957.0		TRUMP	Look what happened to her.
0	958.0		TRUMP	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.
0	959.0		TRUMP	That's what we learned.
0	960.0		TRUMP	Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.
0	961.0		TRUMP	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.
0	962.0		TRUMP	ISIS.
0	963.0		TRUMP	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.
0	964.0		TRUMP	It is -- it is a huge problem.
0	965.0		TRUMP	I have a son.
0	966.0		TRUMP	He's 10 years old.
0	967.0		TRUMP	He has computers.
0	968.0		TRUMP	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.
0	969.0		TRUMP	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.
0	970.0		TRUMP	And maybe it's hardly doable.
0	971.0		TRUMP	But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.
0	972.0		TRUMP	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.
0	973.0		TRUMP	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.
0	974.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	975.0		CLINTON	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.
0	976.0		CLINTON	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.
0	977.0		CLINTON	It does involve going after them online.
0	978.0		CLINTON	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.
0	979.0		CLINTON	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.
0	980.0		CLINTON	We're making progress.
0	981.0		CLINTON	Our military is assisting in Iraq.
0	982.0		CLINTON	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.
0	983.0		CLINTON	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.
0	984.0		CLINTON	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.
0	985.0		CLINTON	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.
0	986.0		CLINTON	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.
0	987.0		CLINTON	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.
0	988.0		HOLT	You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.
0	989.0		HOLT	I'll ask this to both of you.
0	990.0		HOLT	Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?
0	991.0		TRUMP	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.
0	992.0		TRUMP	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.
0	993.0		TRUMP	We will take out ISIS.
0	994.0		TRUMP	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.
0	995.0		TRUMP	And ISIS was formed.
0	996.0		TRUMP	So she talks about taking them out.
0	997.0		TRUMP	She's been doing it a long time.
0	998.0		TRUMP	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.
0	999.0		TRUMP	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.
0	1000.0		TRUMP	And then you wouldn't have had them.
0	1001.0		TRUMP	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.
1	1002.0		TRUMP	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.
0	1003.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	1004.0		CLINTON	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.
0	1005.0		CLINTON	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.
0	1006.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	1007.0		CLINTON	That is absolutely proved over and over again.
0	1008.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	1009.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	1010.0		CLINTON	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.
0	1011.0		CLINTON	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.
0	1012.0		CLINTON	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.
0	1013.0		CLINTON	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.
0	1014.0		CLINTON	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?
0	1015.0		CLINTON	That's the most important part of this.
0	1016.0		CLINTON	How do we prevent attacks?
0	1017.0		CLINTON	How do we protect our people?
0	1018.0		CLINTON	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.
0	1019.0		CLINTON	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.
0	1020.0		CLINTON	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.
0	1021.0		CLINTON	And they brought him down.
0	1022.0		CLINTON	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.
0	1023.0		CLINTON	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.
0	1024.0		CLINTON	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.
0	1025.0		CLINTON	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.
0	1026.0		CLINTON	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.
0	1027.0		CLINTON	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.
0	1028.0		CLINTON	They're on the front lines.
0	1029.0		CLINTON	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.
0	1030.0		CLINTON	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.
0	1031.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump...
0	1032.0		TRUMP	Well, I have to respond.
0	1033.0		HOLT	Please respond.
0	1034.0		TRUMP	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.
0	1035.0		TRUMP	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.
0	1036.0		TRUMP	Under your direction, to a large extent.
0	1037.0		TRUMP	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.
0	1038.0		TRUMP	They were choking on the sanctions.
0	1039.0		TRUMP	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.
0	1040.0		TRUMP	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?
0	1041.0		TRUMP	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.
0	1042.0		TRUMP	I did really well.
0	1043.0		TRUMP	But I have common sense.
0	1044.0		TRUMP	And I said, well, I'll tell you.
0	1045.0		TRUMP	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.
0	1046.0		TRUMP	But two things.
0	1047.0		TRUMP	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.
0	1048.0		TRUMP	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.
0	1049.0		TRUMP	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.
0	1050.0		TRUMP	And I was very strong.
0	1051.0		TRUMP	And I said it numerous times.
0	1052.0		TRUMP	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.
0	1053.0		TRUMP	And I think that's great.
0	1054.0		TRUMP	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.
0	1055.0		TRUMP	It's a lot of money to protect other people.
0	1056.0		TRUMP	But I'm all for NATO.
0	1057.0		TRUMP	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.
0	1058.0		TRUMP	And they're going to do that.
0	1059.0		TRUMP	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
1	1060.0		TRUMP	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.
1	1061.0		TRUMP	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.
1	1062.0		TRUMP	Not only that, you named the day.
0	1063.0		TRUMP	They couldn't believe it.
0	1064.0		TRUMP	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.
0	1065.0		TRUMP	They said...
0	1066.0		CLINTON	Lester, we've covered...
0	1067.0		TRUMP	No, wait a minute.
0	1068.0		CLINTON	We've covered this ground.
0	1069.0		TRUMP	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.
0	1070.0		TRUMP	It should have never happened.
0	1071.0		TRUMP	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.
0	1072.0		TRUMP	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.
0	1073.0		TRUMP	Now it's in over 30 countries.
0	1074.0		TRUMP	And you're going to stop them?
0	1075.0		TRUMP	I don't think so.
0	1076.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.
0	1077.0		HOLT	You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.
0	1078.0		HOLT	What makes your...
0	1079.0		TRUMP	I did not support the war in Iraq.
0	1080.0		HOLT	In 2002...
0	1081.0		TRUMP	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.
0	1082.0		HOLT	My question is, since you supported it...
0	1083.0		TRUMP	Just -- would you like to hear...
0	1084.0		HOLT	why is your -- why is your judgment...
0	1085.0		TRUMP	Wait a minute.
1	1086.0		TRUMP	I was against the war in Iraq.
0	1087.0		TRUMP	Just so you put it out.
0	1088.0		HOLT	The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...
0	1089.0		TRUMP	The record does not show that.
0	1090.0		HOLT	Why was -- is your judgment any...
0	1091.0		TRUMP	The record shows that I'm right.
0	1092.0		TRUMP	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?
0	1093.0		TRUMP	Essentially.
0	1094.0		TRUMP	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.
0	1095.0		TRUMP	We talked about the economy is more important.
0	1096.0		TRUMP	I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.
0	1097.0		TRUMP	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.
1	1098.0		TRUMP	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.
0	1099.0		HOLT	Why is your judgment better than...
0	1100.0		TRUMP	And when he -- excuse me.
0	1101.0		TRUMP	And that was before the war started.
0	1102.0		TRUMP	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.
1	1103.0		TRUMP	I was against the war.
0	1104.0		TRUMP	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.
0	1105.0		TRUMP	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.
0	1106.0		TRUMP	But nobody called Sean Hannity.
0	1107.0		TRUMP	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.
0	1108.0		TRUMP	I think in '04.
0	1109.0		TRUMP	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.
0	1110.0		TRUMP	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.
0	1111.0		TRUMP	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.
0	1112.0		TRUMP	He and I used to have arguments about the war.
0	1113.0		TRUMP	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.
0	1114.0		TRUMP	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.
0	1115.0		TRUMP	And that's exactly what it's done.
0	1116.0		TRUMP	It's been a disaster.
0	1117.0		HOLT	My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...
0	1118.0		TRUMP	No, no.
0	1119.0		TRUMP	You didn't hear what I said.
0	1120.0		HOLT	Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?
0	1121.0		TRUMP	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.
0	1122.0		TRUMP	There's no question about that.
0	1123.0		TRUMP	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?
0	1124.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1125.0		TRUMP	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.
0	1126.0		TRUMP	I have a winning temperament.
0	1127.0		TRUMP	I know how to win.
0	1128.0		TRUMP	She does not have a...
0	1129.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	1130.0		TRUMP	Wait.
0	1131.0		TRUMP	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.
0	1132.0		TRUMP	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.
0	1133.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	1134.0		CLINTON	Whew, OK.
0	1135.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1136.0		CLINTON	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.
0	1137.0		CLINTON	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.
0	1138.0		CLINTON	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?
0	1139.0		CLINTON	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.
0	1140.0		CLINTON	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.
0	1141.0		CLINTON	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.
0	1142.0		CLINTON	They had built covert facilities.
0	1143.0		CLINTON	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.
0	1144.0		CLINTON	And we had sanctioned them.
0	1145.0		CLINTON	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.
0	1146.0		CLINTON	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.
0	1147.0		CLINTON	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.
0	1148.0		CLINTON	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.
0	1149.0		CLINTON	That's diplomacy.
0	1150.0		CLINTON	That's coalition-building.
0	1151.0		CLINTON	That's working with other nations.
0	1152.0		CLINTON	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.
0	1153.0		CLINTON	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.
0	1154.0		CLINTON	That's not good judgment.
0	1155.0		TRUMP	That would not start a war.
0	1156.0		CLINTON	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.
0	1157.0		CLINTON	And the worst part...
0	1158.0		TRUMP	No, they were taunting us.
0	1159.0		CLINTON	of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.
0	1160.0		CLINTON	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
0	1161.0		CLINTON	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
0	1162.0		CLINTON	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...
0	1163.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	1164.0		CLINTON	have a good time, folks.
0	1165.0		TRUMP	It's lies.
0	1166.0		CLINTON	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.
0	1167.0		CLINTON	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.
0	1168.0		CLINTON	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.
0	1169.0		CLINTON	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.
0	1170.0		TRUMP	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.
0	1171.0		TRUMP	I would like to...
0	1172.0		CLINTON	It's a good one, though.
0	1173.0		CLINTON	It well describes the problem.
0	1174.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1175.0		TRUMP	It's not an accurate one at all.
0	1176.0		TRUMP	It's not an accurate one.
0	1177.0		TRUMP	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.
0	1178.0		TRUMP	I agree with her on one thing.
0	1179.0		TRUMP	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.
0	1180.0		TRUMP	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.
0	1181.0		TRUMP	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.
0	1182.0		TRUMP	They do not pay us.
0	1183.0		TRUMP	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.
0	1184.0		TRUMP	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.
0	1185.0		TRUMP	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.
0	1186.0		TRUMP	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.
0	1187.0		TRUMP	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...
0	1188.0		HOLT	We need to move on.
0	1189.0		TRUMP	Well, wait, but it's very important.
0	1190.0		TRUMP	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.
0	1191.0		TRUMP	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.
0	1192.0		TRUMP	They have to help us out.
0	1193.0		HOLT	Our last...
0	1194.0		TRUMP	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.
0	1195.0		TRUMP	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.
0	1196.0		HOLT	Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.
0	1197.0		HOLT	On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.
0	1198.0		HOLT	Do you support the current policy?
0	1199.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.
0	1200.0		TRUMP	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.
0	1201.0		TRUMP	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.
0	1202.0		TRUMP	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.
0	1203.0		TRUMP	I looked the other night.
0	1204.0		TRUMP	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.
0	1205.0		TRUMP	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.
0	1206.0		TRUMP	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.
0	1207.0		TRUMP	But I would certainly not do first strike.
0	1208.0		TRUMP	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.
0	1209.0		TRUMP	At the same time, we have to be prepared.
0	1210.0		TRUMP	I can't take anything off the table.
0	1211.0		TRUMP	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.
0	1212.0		TRUMP	China should solve that problem for us.
0	1213.0		TRUMP	China should go into North Korea.
0	1214.0		TRUMP	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.
0	1215.0		TRUMP	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.
0	1216.0		TRUMP	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.
0	1217.0		TRUMP	Iran has power over North Korea.
0	1218.0		TRUMP	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.
0	1219.0		TRUMP	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.
0	1220.0		TRUMP	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?
0	1221.0		TRUMP	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?
1	1222.0		TRUMP	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.
0	1223.0		TRUMP	Nobody's ever seen that before.
0	1224.0		TRUMP	That turned out to be wrong.
1	1225.0		TRUMP	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.
0	1226.0		TRUMP	It certainly looks that way.
0	1227.0		TRUMP	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?
0	1228.0		TRUMP	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.
0	1229.0		TRUMP	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.
0	1230.0		TRUMP	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.
0	1231.0		HOLT	Your two minutes is expired.
0	1232.0		TRUMP	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.
0	1233.0		TRUMP	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.
0	1234.0		TRUMP	Believe me, he's not a happy camper.
0	1235.0		HOLT	All right.
0	1236.0		HOLT	Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
0	1237.0		CLINTON	Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.
0	1238.0		CLINTON	Words matter when you run for president.
0	1239.0		CLINTON	And they really matter when you are president.
0	1240.0		CLINTON	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.
0	1241.0		CLINTON	It is essential that America's word be good.
0	1242.0		CLINTON	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.
0	1243.0		CLINTON	I've talked with a number of them.
0	1244.0		CLINTON	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.
0	1245.0		CLINTON	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.
0	1246.0		CLINTON	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.
0	1247.0		CLINTON	But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.
0	1248.0		CLINTON	And Donald never tells you what he would do.
0	1249.0		CLINTON	Would he have started a war?
0	1250.0		CLINTON	Would he have bombed Iran?
0	1251.0		CLINTON	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.
0	1252.0		CLINTON	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.
0	1253.0		CLINTON	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.
0	1254.0		CLINTON	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.
0	1255.0		CLINTON	People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.
0	1256.0		CLINTON	Can they rely on us?
0	1257.0		CLINTON	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?
0	1258.0		CLINTON	That's what I intend to do.
0	1259.0		CLINTON	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.
0	1260.0		CLINTON	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...
0	1261.0		HOLT	Your two minutes is...
0	1262.0		CLINTON	to be given any opportunities at all.
0	1263.0		HOLT	is expired.
0	1264.0		TRUMP	Lester, one thing I'd like to say.
0	1265.0		HOLT	Very quickly.
0	1266.0		HOLT	Twenty seconds.
0	1267.0		TRUMP	I will go very quickly.
0	1268.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.
0	1269.0		TRUMP	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.
0	1270.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump...
0	1271.0		TRUMP	And it's a big problem.
0	1272.0		TRUMP	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.
0	1273.0		TRUMP	We cannot be the policemen of the world.
0	1274.0		TRUMP	We cannot protect countries all over the world...
0	1275.0		HOLT	We have just...
0	1276.0		TRUMP	where they're not paying us what we need.
0	1277.0		HOLT	We have just a few final questions...
0	1278.0		TRUMP	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.
0	1279.0		TRUMP	We need heart.
0	1280.0		TRUMP	We need a lot of things.
0	1281.0		TRUMP	But you have to have some basic ability.
0	1282.0		TRUMP	And sadly, she doesn't have that.
0	1283.0		TRUMP	All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.
0	1284.0		TRUMP	But they weren't taken care of.
0	1285.0		TRUMP	And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.
0	1286.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.
0	1287.0		HOLT	"Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."""
0	1288.0		HOLT	She's standing here right now.
0	1289.0		HOLT	What did you mean by that?
0	1290.0		TRUMP	She doesn't have the look.
0	1291.0		TRUMP	She doesn't have the stamina.
0	1292.0		TRUMP	I said she doesn't have the stamina.
0	1293.0		TRUMP	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.
0	1294.0		TRUMP	To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.
0	1295.0		HOLT	"The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look."""
0	1296.0		TRUMP	You have -- wait a minute.
0	1297.0		TRUMP	Wait a minute, Lester.
0	1298.0		TRUMP	You asked me a question.
0	1299.0		TRUMP	Did you ask me a question?
0	1300.0		TRUMP	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.
0	1301.0		TRUMP	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.
0	1302.0		TRUMP	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?
0	1303.0		TRUMP	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?
0	1304.0		TRUMP	All you have to do is speak to them.
0	1305.0		TRUMP	Wait.
0	1306.0		TRUMP	You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.
0	1307.0		HOLT	Let's let her respond.
0	1308.0		CLINTON	Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.
0	1309.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1310.0		TRUMP	The world -- let me tell you.
0	1311.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you.
0	1312.0		TRUMP	Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.
0	1313.0		TRUMP	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.
0	1314.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1315.0		TRUMP	But it's bad, bad experience.
0	1316.0		TRUMP	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.
0	1317.0		TRUMP	I agree.
0	1318.0		TRUMP	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.
0	1319.0		TRUMP	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.
0	1320.0		HOLT	We are at -- we are at the final question.
0	1321.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1322.0		CLINTON	Well, one thing.
0	1323.0		CLINTON	One thing, Lester.
0	1324.0		HOLT	Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.
0	1325.0		CLINTON	You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.
0	1326.0		CLINTON	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...
0	1327.0		TRUMP	I never said that.
1	1328.0		CLINTON	women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
0	1329.0		TRUMP	I didn't say that.
0	1330.0		CLINTON	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.
0	1331.0		CLINTON	He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.
0	1332.0		CLINTON	"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""
0	1333.0		CLINTON	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."
0	1334.0		CLINTON	Donald, she has a name.
0	1335.0		TRUMP	Where did you find this?
0	1336.0		TRUMP	Where did you find this?
0	1337.0		CLINTON	Her name is Alicia Machado.
0	1338.0		TRUMP	Where did you find this?
0	1339.0		CLINTON	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...
0	1340.0		TRUMP	Oh, really?
0	1341.0		CLINTON	she's going to vote this November.
0	1342.0		TRUMP	OK, good.
0	1343.0		TRUMP	Let me just tell you...
0	1344.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1345.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...
0	1346.0		TRUMP	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.
0	1347.0		TRUMP	Some of it's said in entertainment.
0	1348.0		TRUMP	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.
0	1349.0		TRUMP	But you want to know the truth?
0	1350.0		TRUMP	I was going to say something...
0	1351.0		HOLT	Please very quickly.
0	1352.0		TRUMP	"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."
0	1353.0		TRUMP	I just can't do it.
0	1354.0		TRUMP	It's inappropriate.
0	1355.0		TRUMP	"It's not nice."""
0	1356.0		TRUMP	But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.
0	1357.0		TRUMP	They're untrue.
0	1358.0		TRUMP	And they're misrepresentations.
0	1359.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.
0	1360.0		TRUMP	And I don't deserve that.
0	1361.0		TRUMP	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.
0	1362.0		TRUMP	It's hundreds of millions of ads.
0	1363.0		TRUMP	And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...
0	1364.0		HOLT	We have to move on to the final question.
0	1365.0		TRUMP	$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.
0	1366.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1367.0		HOLT	One of you will not win this election.
0	1368.0		HOLT	So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?
0	1369.0		HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
0	1370.0		CLINTON	Well, I support our democracy.
0	1371.0		CLINTON	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
0	1372.0		CLINTON	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.
0	1373.0		CLINTON	And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.
0	1374.0		CLINTON	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.
0	1375.0		CLINTON	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.
0	1376.0		HOLT	Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question.
0	1377.0		HOLT	Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?
0	1378.0		TRUMP	I want to make America great again.
0	1379.0		TRUMP	We are a nation that is seriously troubled.
0	1380.0		TRUMP	We're losing our jobs.
0	1381.0		TRUMP	People are pouring into our country.
0	1382.0		TRUMP	The other day, we were deporting 800 people.
0	1383.0		TRUMP	And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.
0	1384.0		TRUMP	Ended up becoming citizens.
0	1385.0		TRUMP	And it was 800.
0	1386.0		TRUMP	And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.
0	1387.0		HOLT	Will you accept the outcome of the election?
0	1388.0		TRUMP	Look, here's the story.
0	1389.0		TRUMP	I want to make America great again.
0	1390.0		TRUMP	I'm going to be able to do it.
0	1391.0		TRUMP	I don't believe Hillary will.
0	1392.0		TRUMP	The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.
0	1393.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1394.0		HOLT	All right.
0	1395.0		HOLT	Well, that is going to do it for us.
0	1396.0		HOLT	That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.
0	1397.0		HOLT	We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.
0	1398.0		HOLT	The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.
0	1399.0		HOLT	The conversation will continue.
0	1400.0		HOLT	A reminder.
0	1401.0		HOLT	The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.
0	1402.0		HOLT	My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.
0	1403.0		HOLT	Good night, everyone.
0	1.0		QUIJANO	Good evening.
0	2.0		QUIJANO	From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
0	3.0		QUIJANO	I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News.
0	4.0		QUIJANO	It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.
0	5.0		QUIJANO	Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.
0	6.0		QUIJANO	The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.
0	7.0		QUIJANO	There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.
0	8.0		QUIJANO	Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.
0	9.0		QUIJANO	Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.
0	10.0		QUIJANO	By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.
0	11.0		QUIJANO	We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.
0	12.0		QUIJANO	They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.
0	13.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	14.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen, welcome.
0	15.0		QUIJANO	It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.
0	16.0		QUIJANO	I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.
0	17.0		QUIJANO	Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.
0	18.0		QUIJANO	What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?
0	19.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	20.0		KAINE	Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome.
0	21.0		KAINE	It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.
0	22.0		KAINE	This is a very special place.
0	23.0		KAINE	Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School.
0	24.0		KAINE	She made history by protesting school segregation.
0	25.0		KAINE	She believed our nation was stronger together.
0	26.0		KAINE	And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.
0	27.0		KAINE	I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.
0	28.0		KAINE	I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.
0	29.0		KAINE	That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.
0	30.0		KAINE	Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.
0	31.0		KAINE	She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.
0	32.0		KAINE	It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.
0	33.0		KAINE	And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.
0	34.0		KAINE	You've been a city councilman and mayor.
0	35.0		KAINE	You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.
0	36.0		KAINE	I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.
0	37.0		KAINE	And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government.
0	38.0		KAINE	But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.
0	39.0		KAINE	And I relish that role.
0	40.0		KAINE	I'm so proud of her.
0	41.0		KAINE	I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life.
0	42.0		KAINE	We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.
0	43.0		KAINE	We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.
0	44.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	45.0		PENCE	Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.
0	46.0		PENCE	It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family.
0	47.0		PENCE	And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well.
0	48.0		PENCE	And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.
0	49.0		PENCE	For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened.
0	50.0		PENCE	We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.
0	51.0		PENCE	And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.
0	52.0		PENCE	I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.
0	53.0		PENCE	I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville.
0	54.0		PENCE	I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.
0	55.0		PENCE	My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.
0	56.0		PENCE	My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.
0	57.0		PENCE	They built a family and -- and a good name and a business.
0	58.0		PENCE	And they raised a family.
0	59.0		PENCE	And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.
0	60.0		PENCE	So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States.
0	61.0		PENCE	And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.
0	62.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy.
0	63.0		QUIJANO	Why do so many people distrust her?
0	64.0		QUIJANO	Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?
0	65.0		KAINE	Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.
0	66.0		KAINE	Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.
0	67.0		KAINE	Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?
0	68.0		KAINE	And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?
0	69.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton has that passion.
0	70.0		KAINE	From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids.
0	71.0		KAINE	As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.
0	72.0		KAINE	And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.
0	73.0		KAINE	Donald Trump always puts himself first.
0	74.0		KAINE	"He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."""
0	75.0		KAINE	And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.
0	76.0		KAINE	It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.
0	77.0		KAINE	"And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump."
0	78.0		QUIJANO	"Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."""
0	79.0		QUIJANO	Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president.
0	80.0		QUIJANO	Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?
0	81.0		PENCE	Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign.
0	82.0		PENCE	It really is remarkable.
0	83.0		PENCE	At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.
0	84.0		PENCE	I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.
0	85.0		PENCE	The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...
0	86.0		KAINE	You guys love Russia.
0	87.0		KAINE	You both have said...
0	88.0		PENCE	their heavy-handed approach.
0	89.0		KAINE	You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.
0	90.0		PENCE	Well...
0	91.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	92.0		QUIJANO	Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment.
0	93.0		QUIJANO	But I do want to get back to the question at...
0	94.0		PENCE	But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you.
0	95.0		PENCE	Thank you.
0	96.0		PENCE	Thank you, Senator, I'll...
0	97.0		KAINE	These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
0	98.0		KAINE	How can that...
0	99.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	100.0		QUIJANO	Yes, and we will get to that, Senator.
0	101.0		QUIJANO	We do have that coming up here.
0	102.0		QUIJANO	But in the meantime, the questions...
0	103.0		PENCE	Well, Senator, I must have hit a...
0	104.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	105.0		PENCE	I must have hit a nerve here.
0	106.0		QUIJANO	Why the disconnect?
0	107.0		PENCE	Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.
0	108.0		PENCE	Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times.
0	109.0		PENCE	He's brought an extraordinary business acumen.
0	110.0		PENCE	He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.
0	111.0		KAINE	And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.
0	112.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	113.0		QUIJANO	And why the disconnect with your running mate?
0	114.0		PENCE	But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.
0	115.0		PENCE	And that's because they're paying attention.
0	116.0		PENCE	I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on.
0	117.0		PENCE	She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.
0	118.0		KAINE	You are Donald Trump's apprentice.
0	119.0		KAINE	Let me talk about this...
0	120.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	121.0		PENCE	Senator, I think I'm still on my time.
0	122.0		KAINE	Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?
0	123.0		QUIJANO	This is our open discussion.
0	124.0		KAINE	Yeah, let's talk about the state of...
0	125.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	126.0		PENCE	Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.
0	127.0		KAINE	Finish your sentence.
0	128.0		PENCE	The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.
0	129.0		KAINE	OK, now I can weigh in.
0	130.0		KAINE	Now...
0	131.0		PENCE	She had a private server...
0	132.0		KAINE	Now, I get to weigh in.
0	133.0		KAINE	Now, let me just say this...
0	134.0		PENCE	that was discovered...
0	135.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	136.0		QUIJANO	Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.
0	137.0		PENCE	keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.
0	138.0		KAINE	Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.
0	139.0		PENCE	Do you?
0	140.0		KAINE	Let me tell you this.
0	141.0		KAINE	When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?
0	142.0		PENCE	Yes.
0	143.0		KAINE	Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?
0	144.0		KAINE	Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?
0	145.0		KAINE	Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth.
1	146.0		KAINE	She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.
1	147.0		KAINE	She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.
0	148.0		PENCE	Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?
0	149.0		KAINE	Absolutely, without firing a shot.
0	150.0		KAINE	And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.
0	151.0		PENCE	Right and...
0	152.0		KAINE	These are very, very good things.
0	153.0		PENCE	And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...
0	154.0		KAINE	Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.
0	155.0		PENCE	Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...
0	156.0		KAINE	No, that is incorrect.
0	157.0		KAINE	That's incorrect.
0	158.0		PENCE	And so we removed -- we removed all of our...
0	159.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen, we'll get to...
0	160.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	161.0		PENCE	troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.
0	162.0		KAINE	But I'd like to correct...
0	163.0		PENCE	and overrun vast areas of Iraq.
1	164.0		KAINE	Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.
1	165.0		KAINE	And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.
0	166.0		KAINE	And guess what?
0	167.0		KAINE	If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.
0	168.0		PENCE	It was a failure of the secretary of state...
0	169.0		QUIJANO	We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.
0	170.0		KAINE	If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...
0	171.0		QUIJANO	There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.
0	172.0		QUIJANO	Let's turn to the issue of the economy.
0	173.0		KAINE	OK.
0	174.0		QUIJANO	According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.
0	175.0		QUIJANO	In fact, your plans would add even more to it.
0	176.0		QUIJANO	Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.
0	177.0		QUIJANO	Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.
0	178.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	179.0		PENCE	I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.
0	180.0		PENCE	I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.
1	181.0		PENCE	The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.
1	182.0		PENCE	We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.
0	183.0		PENCE	That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.
0	184.0		PENCE	He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.
0	185.0		PENCE	He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.
1	186.0		PENCE	In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.
0	187.0		PENCE	But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.
0	188.0		PENCE	It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.
0	189.0		PENCE	You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.
0	190.0		PENCE	But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.
0	191.0		PENCE	But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.
0	192.0		PENCE	They want to expand it into a single-payer program.
0	193.0		PENCE	And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.
0	194.0		PENCE	Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.
0	195.0		PENCE	We can get America moving again.
0	196.0		PENCE	Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.
0	197.0		PENCE	And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.
0	198.0		PENCE	When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.
0	199.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	200.0		KAINE	Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.
0	201.0		KAINE	"Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump?"
0	202.0		KAINE	I think that's not such a hard choice.
0	203.0		KAINE	"Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan."
0	204.0		KAINE	Five components.
0	205.0		KAINE	First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.
0	206.0		KAINE	Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.
0	207.0		KAINE	Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.
0	208.0		KAINE	Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.
0	209.0		KAINE	Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.
0	210.0		KAINE	My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.
0	211.0		KAINE	And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.
0	212.0		KAINE	The Trump plan is a different plan.
0	213.0		KAINE	"It's a ""you're fired"" plan."
0	214.0		KAINE	And there's two key elements to it.
1	215.0		KAINE	First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.
0	216.0		KAINE	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.
0	217.0		KAINE	Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.
0	218.0		KAINE	And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.
0	219.0		KAINE	The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.
0	220.0		KAINE	The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.
1	221.0		KAINE	Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.
1	222.0		KAINE	The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.
0	223.0		KAINE	And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?
0	224.0		KAINE	Because his tax plan basically helps him.
0	225.0		KAINE	And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.
0	226.0		QUIJANO	On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.
0	227.0		QUIJANO	Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
0	228.0		QUIJANO	Does that seem fair to you?
0	229.0		PENCE	"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator."
0	230.0		PENCE	You use that a whole lot.
0	231.0		PENCE	And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.
0	232.0		PENCE	Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.
0	233.0		PENCE	And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table.
0	234.0		PENCE	I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.
0	235.0		PENCE	We're in the...
1	236.0		KAINE	Fifteen million new jobs?
0	237.0		PENCE	slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
1	238.0		KAINE	Fifteen million new jobs?
0	239.0		QUIJANO	Governor...
0	240.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	241.0		PENCE	There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...
0	242.0		KAINE	And the poverty level and the median income...
0	243.0		PENCE	stepped into the Oval Office.
0	244.0		KAINE	improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.
0	245.0		PENCE	You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different.
0	246.0		PENCE	People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different.
0	247.0		PENCE	I mean, this economy is struggling.
0	248.0		PENCE	The answer to this economy is not more taxes.
0	249.0		KAINE	But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
0	250.0		PENCE	It's not more spending...
0	251.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	252.0		KAINE	I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
0	253.0		PENCE	Absolutely I will.
0	254.0		QUIJANO	Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.
0	255.0		PENCE	Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine.
0	256.0		PENCE	And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician.
0	257.0		PENCE	He actually built a business.
0	258.0		PENCE	Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.
0	259.0		PENCE	But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss.
0	260.0		PENCE	We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.
0	261.0		KAINE	But why won't he release his tax returns?
0	262.0		PENCE	Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...
0	263.0		KAINE	I do want to come back to that, but...
0	264.0		PENCE	His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used.
0	265.0		PENCE	And he did it brilliantly.
0	266.0		KAINE	How do you know that?
0	267.0		KAINE	You haven't seen his tax returns.
0	268.0		PENCE	He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.
0	269.0		KAINE	How do you know that?
0	270.0		PENCE	And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.
0	271.0		PENCE	And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...
0	272.0		KAINE	Elaine, let me talk about something.
0	273.0		QUIJANO	Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.
0	274.0		KAINE	OK.
0	275.0		PENCE	The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.
0	276.0		KAINE	"Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."""
0	277.0		KAINE	He's broken his first...
0	278.0		PENCE	And he will.
0	279.0		KAINE	He's broken his first promise.
0	280.0		KAINE	Second, he stood on the stage...
0	281.0		PENCE	He hasn't broken his promise.
0	282.0		PENCE	He said he's...
0	283.0		KAINE	"He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart."""
0	284.0		KAINE	So it's smart not to pay for our military?
0	285.0		KAINE	It's smart not to pay for veterans?
0	286.0		KAINE	It's smart not to pay for teachers?
0	287.0		KAINE	And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid.
0	288.0		KAINE	And the last thing I'll say is this...
0	289.0		PENCE	Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?
0	290.0		KAINE	The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...
0	291.0		PENCE	I do.
0	292.0		KAINE	Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.
0	293.0		KAINE	Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president.
0	294.0		KAINE	And he's breaking his promise.
0	295.0		PENCE	Elaine, I have to respond to this.
0	296.0		QUIJANO	You get very little time, 20 seconds.
0	297.0		PENCE	I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.
0	298.0		QUIJANO	Governor?
0	299.0		PENCE	Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.
0	300.0		KAINE	But he said he would release his tax returns.
0	301.0		QUIJANO	All right, Gentlemen...
0	302.0		PENCE	The American people can review that.
0	303.0		PENCE	And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...
0	304.0		QUIJANO	I need to ask you about Social Security...
1	305.0		KAINE	Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.
0	306.0		PENCE	They're going to raise your taxes.
0	307.0		PENCE	We're going to cut your taxes.
0	308.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen...
0	309.0		KAINE	If you can't meet Nixon's standard...
0	310.0		QUIJANO	The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other.
0	311.0		QUIJANO	I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.
0	312.0		KAINE	All right.
0	313.0		KAINE	We're having fun up here.
0	314.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76.
0	315.0		QUIJANO	The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year.
0	316.0		QUIJANO	What would your administration do to prevent this cut?
0	317.0		KAINE	First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done.
0	318.0		KAINE	It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty.
0	319.0		KAINE	And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.
0	320.0		KAINE	We have to keep it solvent.
0	321.0		KAINE	And we will keep it solvent.
0	322.0		KAINE	And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.
0	323.0		KAINE	Here's what Hillary and I will not do.
0	324.0		KAINE	And I want to make this very plain.
0	325.0		KAINE	We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.
0	326.0		KAINE	Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.
0	327.0		KAINE	And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.
0	328.0		KAINE	Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it.
0	329.0		KAINE	We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security.
0	330.0		KAINE	And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.
0	331.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond.
0	332.0		PENCE	Well, thanks, Elaine.
0	333.0		PENCE	There they go again.
0	334.0		PENCE	OK...
0	335.0		KAINE	Go read -- go read the book.
0	336.0		PENCE	All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors.
0	337.0		PENCE	That's it.
0	338.0		KAINE	Go read the book.
0	339.0		PENCE	We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare.
0	340.0		PENCE	That's what this campaign is really about, Senator.
0	341.0		PENCE	And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out...
0	342.0		KAINE	But -- but you have a voting record, Governor.
0	343.0		PENCE	And I get all of that.
0	344.0		PENCE	I just, look...
0	345.0		KAINE	I...
0	346.0		PENCE	There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.
0	347.0		KAINE	I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.
0	348.0		PENCE	I have to go back to.
0	349.0		QUIJANO	We...
0	350.0		PENCE	Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security.
0	351.0		PENCE	Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes.
0	352.0		PENCE	We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to...
1	353.0		KAINE	You're not going to cut taxes.
1	354.0		KAINE	You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.
0	355.0		PENCE	reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.
0	356.0		QUIJANO	All right.
0	357.0		PENCE	Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt.
0	358.0		PENCE	And we're going to face hard choices and...
0	359.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	360.0		QUIJANO	Gentleman, I want to move on now.
0	361.0		KAINE	You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.
0	362.0		QUIJANO	All right.
0	363.0		QUIJANO	Let me move on now...
0	364.0		PENCE	Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy.
0	365.0		QUIJANO	to the issue of law enforcement and race relations.
0	366.0		QUIJANO	Law enforcement and race relations.
0	367.0		QUIJANO	"After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, ""We're asking cops to do too much in this country."
0	368.0		QUIJANO	Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve.
0	369.0		QUIJANO	"Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."""
0	370.0		QUIJANO	Do we ask too much of police officers in this country?
0	371.0		QUIJANO	And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns?
0	372.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	373.0		KAINE	Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment.
0	374.0		KAINE	I think we put a lot on police shoulders.
0	375.0		KAINE	And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.
0	376.0		KAINE	I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.
0	377.0		KAINE	And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.
0	378.0		KAINE	We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.
0	379.0		KAINE	And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too.
0	380.0		KAINE	And we did something we had really wanted to do.
0	381.0		KAINE	For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.
0	382.0		KAINE	Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.
0	383.0		KAINE	The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.
0	384.0		KAINE	You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.
0	385.0		KAINE	And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.
0	386.0		KAINE	That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.
0	387.0		KAINE	Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.
0	388.0		KAINE	That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.
0	389.0		KAINE	So here's what we'll do.
0	390.0		KAINE	We'll focus on community policing.
0	391.0		KAINE	We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.
0	392.0		KAINE	I'm a gun-owner.
0	393.0		KAINE	I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.
0	394.0		KAINE	But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.
0	395.0		KAINE	And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.
0	396.0		KAINE	One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu.
0	397.0		KAINE	He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor.
0	398.0		KAINE	He had survived the Holocaust.
0	399.0		KAINE	Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.
0	400.0		KAINE	But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence.
0	401.0		KAINE	We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.
0	402.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	403.0		PENCE	You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago.
0	404.0		PENCE	He was my hero when I was growing up.
0	405.0		PENCE	And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago.
0	406.0		PENCE	My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side.
0	407.0		PENCE	Police officers are the best of us.
0	408.0		PENCE	And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day.
0	409.0		PENCE	And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea.
0	410.0		PENCE	It's worked in the Hoosier state.
0	411.0		PENCE	And we fully support that.
0	412.0		PENCE	Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.
0	413.0		PENCE	It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.
0	414.0		PENCE	They see his commitment to law and order.
0	415.0		PENCE	But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.
0	416.0		PENCE	And that really has got to stop.
0	417.0		PENCE	I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.
0	418.0		PENCE	I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn.
0	419.0		PENCE	We -- we grieve with those who grieve.
0	420.0		PENCE	And we're saddened at the loss of life.
1	421.0		PENCE	But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.
0	422.0		PENCE	I just think...
0	423.0		KAINE	Can I -- can I explain...
0	424.0		PENCE	I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.
0	425.0		PENCE	We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.
0	426.0		PENCE	But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.
0	427.0		KAINE	Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement.
0	428.0		KAINE	And if you're afraid to have...
0	429.0		PENCE	I'm not afraid to bring that up.
0	430.0		KAINE	And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it.
0	431.0		KAINE	And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking.
0	432.0		KAINE	We would agree this was a heartbreaking example.
0	433.0		KAINE	The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school.
0	434.0		KAINE	And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.
0	435.0		KAINE	But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked.
0	436.0		KAINE	The kids loved him.
0	437.0		KAINE	But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.
0	438.0		KAINE	And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.
0	439.0		PENCE	We need criminal justice reform.
0	440.0		KAINE	Well, we do.
0	441.0		PENCE	Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.
0	442.0		KAINE	But I just want to say, those who say that we should not...
0	443.0		PENCE	But that's not what you're talking about.
0	444.0		KAINE	we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem...
0	445.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence...
0	446.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	447.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence...
1	448.0		PENCE	Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?
0	449.0		KAINE	Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even...
0	450.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	451.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence, I have a question on that point.
0	452.0		PENCE	I did not make that statement.
0	453.0		PENCE	I...
0	454.0		QUIJANO	Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor.
0	455.0		QUIJANO	He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.
0	456.0		KAINE	A U.S. senator.
0	457.0		QUIJANO	"He said, ""I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."""
0	458.0		QUIJANO	What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?
0	459.0		PENCE	Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend.
0	460.0		PENCE	And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally.
0	461.0		PENCE	I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it.
0	462.0		PENCE	I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act.
0	463.0		PENCE	We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice.
0	464.0		PENCE	But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement.
0	465.0		PENCE	We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...
0	466.0		KAINE	Elaine, can I...
0	467.0		QUIJANO	So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?
0	468.0		PENCE	Law enforcement in this country is a force for good.
0	469.0		PENCE	They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day.
0	470.0		PENCE	But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement.
0	471.0		PENCE	You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk.
0	472.0		PENCE	Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime...
0	473.0		KAINE	Elaine, let me -- let me...
0	474.0		QUIJANO	Governor, the question is about Senator Scott.
0	475.0		QUIJANO	What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott?
0	476.0		KAINE	Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in.
0	477.0		KAINE	I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea.
0	478.0		KAINE	And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law.
0	479.0		KAINE	So there is a fundamental respect issue here.
0	480.0		KAINE	And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top.
0	481.0		KAINE	Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.
0	482.0		KAINE	He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.
0	483.0		KAINE	I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother.
0	484.0		KAINE	He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican.
0	485.0		KAINE	He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured.
0	486.0		KAINE	He said African-Americans are living in Hell.
0	487.0		KAINE	And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.
0	488.0		KAINE	If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about.
0	489.0		KAINE	And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.
0	490.0		QUIJANO	All right.
0	491.0		QUIJANO	I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration.
0	492.0		QUIJANO	Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported.
0	493.0		QUIJANO	What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes?
0	494.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	495.0		PENCE	Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.
0	496.0		PENCE	We've been talking it to death for 20 years.
0	497.0		PENCE	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.
0	498.0		PENCE	But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement.
0	499.0		PENCE	It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.
0	500.0		PENCE	And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas.
0	501.0		PENCE	And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.
0	502.0		PENCE	But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.
0	503.0		KAINE	These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor.
0	504.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	505.0		PENCE	It's my time, Senator.
0	506.0		QUIJANO	It is, in fact, the governor's time.
0	507.0		KAINE	I apologize.
0	508.0		KAINE	It's your two minutes.
0	509.0		KAINE	I apologize.
0	510.0		PENCE	Thanks.
0	511.0		PENCE	I forgive you.
0	512.0		PENCE	He says ours is an insult-driven campaign.
0	513.0		PENCE	Did you all just hear that?
0	514.0		PENCE	Ours is an insult-driven campaign?
0	515.0		PENCE	I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.
0	516.0		PENCE	It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.
0	517.0		PENCE	I mean, it's extraordinary.
0	518.0		PENCE	"And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all."
0	519.0		PENCE	So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean...
0	520.0		QUIJANO	Governor...
0	521.0		PENCE	That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...
0	522.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	523.0		PENCE	calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.
0	524.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that.
0	525.0		PENCE	She said she shouldn't have said half.
0	526.0		QUIJANO	Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.
0	527.0		KAINE	Yeah, that's right, so now we're even.
0	528.0		PENCE	Yeah.
0	529.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	530.0		KAINE	Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...
0	531.0		PENCE	Oh...
0	532.0		KAINE	to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.
0	533.0		PENCE	"She apologized for saying ""half."""
0	534.0		QUIJANO	Governor.
0	535.0		QUIJANO	It is his two minutes, please.
0	536.0		KAINE	Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?
0	537.0		KAINE	Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell?
0	538.0		KAINE	Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?
0	539.0		KAINE	You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.
0	540.0		KAINE	Immigration.
0	541.0		KAINE	There's two plans on the table.
0	542.0		KAINE	Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform.
0	543.0		KAINE	Donald Trump believes in deportation nation.
0	544.0		KAINE	You've got to pick your choice.
0	545.0		KAINE	Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.
0	546.0		KAINE	That's our proposal.
0	547.0		KAINE	Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents.
0	548.0		KAINE	And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.
0	549.0		KAINE	So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that.
0	550.0		KAINE	That's another 4.5 million people.
0	551.0		KAINE	These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force.
0	552.0		KAINE	They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.
0	553.0		KAINE	And I cannot believe...
0	554.0		PENCE	That's nonsense.
0	555.0		PENCE	That's nonsense.
0	556.0		KAINE	I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.
0	557.0		PENCE	Senator, we have a deportation force.
0	558.0		PENCE	It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
0	559.0		PENCE	And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.
0	560.0		KAINE	So you like the 16 million deportations?
0	561.0		PENCE	Senator, that's -- that's nonsense.
1	562.0		PENCE	Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.
0	563.0		PENCE	That's...
0	564.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	565.0		KAINE	Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.
0	566.0		PENCE	They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill.
0	567.0		PENCE	We all know the routine.
0	568.0		PENCE	It's amnesty.
0	569.0		PENCE	And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.
0	570.0		PENCE	That's how Washington always plays it.
0	571.0		KAINE	No, I...
0	572.0		PENCE	They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border...
0	573.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	574.0		KAINE	border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.
0	575.0		QUIJANO	Governor, Mr. Trump has said...
0	576.0		PENCE	Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.
0	577.0		PENCE	Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.
0	578.0		QUIJANO	So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave?
0	579.0		QUIJANO	Would they be forcibly removed?
0	580.0		PENCE	Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security.
0	581.0		PENCE	It begins with border security.
0	582.0		PENCE	And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.
0	583.0		PENCE	But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens.
0	584.0		PENCE	We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement.
0	585.0		PENCE	We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities.
0	586.0		PENCE	The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity.
0	587.0		PENCE	And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.
0	588.0		PENCE	Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas.
0	589.0		PENCE	We're going to enforce the law of this country.
0	590.0		PENCE	We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that.
0	591.0		PENCE	And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...
0	592.0		KAINE	I just have to correct Governor Pence....
0	593.0		PENCE	where people can come into this country.
0	594.0		KAINE	I have to...
0	595.0		PENCE	That's the order that you should do it.
0	596.0		PENCE	Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.
0	597.0		KAINE	I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in.
0	598.0		KAINE	But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said.
0	599.0		KAINE	When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.
0	600.0		KAINE	"He said, quote, ""They will all be gone."""
0	601.0		KAINE	They will all be gone.
0	602.0		KAINE	And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said.
0	603.0		KAINE	And to add...
0	604.0		PENCE	He's talking about criminal aliens.
0	605.0		KAINE	And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants.
0	606.0		KAINE	Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families.
0	607.0		KAINE	Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger.
0	608.0		KAINE	When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.
0	609.0		QUIJANO	Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism.
0	610.0		QUIJANO	Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?
0	611.0		QUIJANO	Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?
0	612.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	613.0		KAINE	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead.
0	614.0		KAINE	The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped.
0	615.0		KAINE	The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world.
0	616.0		KAINE	There's only 15,000.
0	617.0		KAINE	But there are other parts of the world that are challenging.
0	618.0		KAINE	Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton.
0	619.0		KAINE	Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11.
0	620.0		KAINE	She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors.
0	621.0		KAINE	That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.
0	622.0		KAINE	And she's got a plan to do it.
0	623.0		KAINE	She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden.
0	624.0		KAINE	Here's her plan to defeat ISIL.
0	625.0		KAINE	First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield.
0	626.0		KAINE	She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.
0	627.0		KAINE	Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens.
0	628.0		KAINE	But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence.
0	629.0		KAINE	That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.
0	630.0		KAINE	Donald Trump.
0	631.0		KAINE	Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot.
0	632.0		KAINE	Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.
0	633.0		KAINE	"He said, I have a secret plan,"" and then he said, Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."
0	634.0		KAINE	"And then he said, ""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."""
0	635.0		KAINE	"And finally he said, ""I'm going to fire all the generals."""
0	636.0		KAINE	He doesn't have a plan.
0	637.0		KAINE	But he does have dangerous ideas.
0	638.0		KAINE	Here's four.
0	639.0		KAINE	He trash talks the military.
0	640.0		KAINE	The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.
0	641.0		KAINE	He wants to tear up alliances.
0	642.0		KAINE	"NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league."""
0	643.0		KAINE	Third, he loves dictators.
0	644.0		KAINE	He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...
0	645.0		PENCE	Oh, please.
0	646.0		PENCE	Come on.
0	647.0		KAINE	and Saddam Hussein.
1	648.0		KAINE	And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.
1	649.0		KAINE	He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them.
1	650.0		KAINE	"And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."""
0	651.0		KAINE	I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.
0	652.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	653.0		PENCE	Did you work on that one a long time?
0	654.0		PENCE	Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.
0	655.0		KAINE	Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it.
0	656.0		PENCE	Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States.
0	657.0		PENCE	It's absolutely inarguable.
0	658.0		PENCE	We've weakened America's place in the world.
0	659.0		PENCE	It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership.
0	660.0		PENCE	I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11.
0	661.0		PENCE	I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.
0	662.0		KAINE	I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...
0	663.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	664.0		PENCE	I know you were.
0	665.0		PENCE	We all lived through that day as a nation.
0	666.0		PENCE	It was heartbreaking.
0	667.0		PENCE	And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.
0	668.0		PENCE	But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida.
0	669.0		PENCE	Our primary threat today is ISIS.
0	670.0		PENCE	And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
0	671.0		PENCE	My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl.
0	672.0		PENCE	Scott Zubowski.
0	673.0		PENCE	He fell in Fallujah in 2005.
0	674.0		PENCE	He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation.
0	675.0		PENCE	And that nation was secured in 2009.
0	676.0		PENCE	But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war.
0	677.0		PENCE	The president just ordered more troops on the ground.
0	678.0		PENCE	We are back at war in Iraq.
0	679.0		PENCE	And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.
0	680.0		PENCE	And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.
0	681.0		KAINE	Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?
0	682.0		PENCE	You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.
0	683.0		KAINE	Yes, we did.
0	684.0		PENCE	You essentially...
0	685.0		KAINE	Even the Israeli military says it stopped.
0	686.0		PENCE	guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.
0	687.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism.
0	688.0		QUIJANO	But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey.
0	689.0		QUIJANO	Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents.
0	690.0		QUIJANO	What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?
0	691.0		PENCE	Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.
0	692.0		PENCE	I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.
0	693.0		PENCE	But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.
0	694.0		PENCE	Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...
0	695.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	696.0		KAINE	Elaine, I want to...
0	697.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	698.0		QUIJANO	Governor, the question was about homegrown.
0	699.0		PENCE	Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program...
0	700.0		KAINE	Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.
0	701.0		PENCE	That's not -- that's absolutely false.
0	702.0		KAINE	That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine.
0	703.0		PENCE	The Seventh Circuit...
0	704.0		KAINE	We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration.
0	705.0		KAINE	Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous?
0	706.0		KAINE	These guys say all Mexicans are bad.
0	707.0		PENCE	That's absolutely false.
0	708.0		KAINE	And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous.
0	709.0		KAINE	Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim.
0	710.0		KAINE	Mike Pence...
0	711.0		PENCE	Absolutely...
0	712.0		KAINE	put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria.
0	713.0		KAINE	And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...
0	714.0		PENCE	Right.
0	715.0		PENCE	Right.
0	716.0		KAINE	and said it was discriminatory...
0	717.0		PENCE	And those judges -- those judges said...
0	718.0		KAINE	We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.
0	719.0		QUIJANO	Governor?
0	720.0		PENCE	Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States.
0	721.0		PENCE	Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.
0	722.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	723.0		KAINE	But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
0	724.0		PENCE	But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game.
0	725.0		PENCE	I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.
0	726.0		KAINE	But, Governor Pence...
0	727.0		PENCE	So you bet I suspended that program.
0	728.0		KAINE	But, Governor Pence, I just...
0	729.0		PENCE	And I stand by that decision.
0	730.0		PENCE	And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
0	731.0		KAINE	Sure.
0	732.0		KAINE	Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not.
0	733.0		KAINE	We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.
0	734.0		PENCE	But the problem with that...
0	735.0		KAINE	That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...
0	736.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	737.0		PENCE	Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.
0	738.0		KAINE	Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in.
0	739.0		PENCE	So -- the FBI...
0	740.0		KAINE	When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.
0	741.0		PENCE	The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain.
0	742.0		PENCE	You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator.
0	743.0		PENCE	I understand the...
0	744.0		KAINE	By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?
0	745.0		PENCE	the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...
0	746.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, let me ask you this.
0	747.0		QUIJANO	Secretary Clinton...
0	748.0		PENCE	We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
0	749.0		QUIJANO	has talked about an intelligence surge.
0	750.0		KAINE	Yes.
0	751.0		QUIJANO	What exactly would an intelligence surge look like?
0	752.0		QUIJANO	And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?
0	753.0		KAINE	Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine.
0	754.0		KAINE	It's two things.
0	755.0		KAINE	It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.
0	756.0		KAINE	So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.
0	757.0		KAINE	But the second piece of this is really, really important.
0	758.0		KAINE	It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies.
0	759.0		KAINE	And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next.
0	760.0		KAINE	Alliances are critical.
1	761.0		KAINE	That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.
0	762.0		PENCE	That's not his plan.
0	763.0		KAINE	Well, he said NATO is obsolete.
0	764.0		KAINE	And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?
0	765.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances.
0	766.0		KAINE	She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0	767.0		KAINE	And that's what an intelligence surge means.
0	768.0		KAINE	Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.
0	769.0		QUIJANO	All right.
0	770.0		QUIJANO	I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria.
0	771.0		QUIJANO	Two hundred fifty thousand...
0	772.0		PENCE	Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
0	773.0		QUIJANO	You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.
0	774.0		PENCE	First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week.
0	775.0		PENCE	We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country.
0	776.0		PENCE	And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.
0	777.0		KAINE	We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
0	778.0		PENCE	We have an intelligence, sir (ph).
0	779.0		PENCE	But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...
0	780.0		QUIJANO	And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up.
0	781.0		PENCE	about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.
0	782.0		QUIJANO	Right.
0	783.0		PENCE	Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...
0	784.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	785.0		QUIJANO	I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor.
0	786.0		PENCE	We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server.
0	787.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1	788.0		KAINE	And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step.
0	789.0		KAINE	You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this.
0	790.0		KAINE	We have a justice system that does that.
1	791.0		KAINE	And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that...
0	792.0		QUIJANO	All right, we are moving on now.
0	793.0		QUIJANO	Two hundred fifty thousand people...
0	794.0		PENCE	If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...
0	795.0		QUIJANO	one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor...
0	796.0		PENCE	they'd be court martialed.
0	797.0		KAINE	That is absolutely false and you know that.
0	798.0		PENCE	Absolutely true.
0	799.0		KAINE	And you know that, Governor.
0	800.0		QUIJANO	Governor...
0	801.0		PENCE	It's absolutely true.
0	802.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen, please.
0	803.0		KAINE	Because the FBI did an investigation.
0	804.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen.
0	805.0		KAINE	And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further.
0	806.0		KAINE	Sorry.
0	807.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.
0	808.0		KAINE	Syria.
0	809.0		QUIJANO	I want to turn now to Syria.
0	810.0		QUIJANO	Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria.
0	811.0		QUIJANO	Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries.
0	812.0		QUIJANO	Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?
0	813.0		PENCE	The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo.
0	814.0		PENCE	Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset.
0	815.0		PENCE	After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.
0	816.0		PENCE	And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.
0	817.0		PENCE	It begins by rebuilding our military.
0	818.0		PENCE	And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military.
0	819.0		PENCE	We have the smallest Navy since 1916.
0	820.0		PENCE	We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War.
0	821.0		PENCE	We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.
0	822.0		PENCE	But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.
0	823.0		PENCE	And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.
0	824.0		PENCE	And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.
0	825.0		PENCE	There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.
0	826.0		PENCE	We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.
0	827.0		QUIJANO	Governor, your two minutes are up.
0	828.0		PENCE	We've just got to have American strength on the world stage.
0	829.0		PENCE	When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president.
0	830.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	831.0		KAINE	Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea.
0	832.0		KAINE	And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not.
0	833.0		KAINE	Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin.
0	834.0		KAINE	And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.
0	835.0		KAINE	The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces.
0	836.0		KAINE	Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.
0	837.0		KAINE	Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.
0	838.0		KAINE	He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists.
0	839.0		KAINE	If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.
0	840.0		KAINE	I'll tell you what offends me...
0	841.0		PENCE	Well, that offended me.
0	842.0		KAINE	Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military.
0	843.0		KAINE	No, he won't.
0	844.0		KAINE	Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes.
0	845.0		KAINE	The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995.
0	846.0		KAINE	Those years included the years of 9/11.
0	847.0		KAINE	So get this.
0	848.0		KAINE	On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States.
0	849.0		KAINE	Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism.
0	850.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight.
0	851.0		KAINE	It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.
0	852.0		QUIJANO	The question was about Aleppo, Senator.
0	853.0		KAINE	He wouldn't support troops.
0	854.0		KAINE	He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine.
0	855.0		KAINE	When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.
0	856.0		QUIJANO	Right.
0	857.0		KAINE	And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria.
0	858.0		KAINE	It's very important.
0	859.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone.
0	860.0		QUIJANO	Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically?
0	861.0		QUIJANO	How would you keep it safe?
0	862.0		PENCE	Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops.
0	863.0		PENCE	Donald Trump supports our veterans.
0	864.0		KAINE	He won't pay taxes.
0	865.0		PENCE	Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?
0	866.0		PENCE	How does that work?
0	867.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen, this is about Syria.
0	868.0		QUIJANO	I'd like to...
0	869.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	870.0		PENCE	Honestly, Senator.
0	871.0		PENCE	Honestly, Senator.
0	872.0		KAINE	It is about our troops.
0	873.0		KAINE	It is about our troops.
0	874.0		PENCE	I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.
0	875.0		KAINE	How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?
0	876.0		PENCE	I understand why you want to change the subject.
0	877.0		PENCE	And let me be very clear on this Russian thing.
0	878.0		PENCE	The larger question here...
0	879.0		KAINE	Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?
0	880.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.
0	881.0		PENCE	What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates.
0	882.0		PENCE	And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.
0	883.0		PENCE	And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore.
0	884.0		PENCE	To answer your question, we just need American strength.
0	885.0		PENCE	We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way.
0	886.0		QUIJANO	And exactly how would those safe zones work?
0	887.0		QUIJANO	How would they remain safe?
0	888.0		PENCE	The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community.
0	889.0		PENCE	The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.
0	890.0		PENCE	But, look, this is very tough stuff.
0	891.0		PENCE	I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade.
0	892.0		PENCE	I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years.
0	893.0		PENCE	I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
0	894.0		PENCE	And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...
0	895.0		KAINE	Well, let me -- let me come back...
0	896.0		PENCE	is deeply troubling to me.
0	897.0		PENCE	That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
0	898.0		KAINE	and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine.
0	899.0		KAINE	He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0	900.0		KAINE	He doesn't want to acknowledge...
0	901.0		PENCE	We didn't.
0	902.0		KAINE	that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden.
0	903.0		KAINE	He doesn't want to acknowledge...
0	904.0		PENCE	I just did.
0	905.0		KAINE	that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.
0	906.0		KAINE	But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous.
0	907.0		KAINE	Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.
0	908.0		KAINE	Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.
0	909.0		KAINE	He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.
0	910.0		KAINE	And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.
0	911.0		PENCE	And come on.
0	912.0		PENCE	Senator.
0	913.0		PENCE	Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton.
0	914.0		PENCE	And that -- that's pretty low.
0	915.0		KAINE	But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?
0	916.0		PENCE	Senator, the...
0	917.0		KAINE	That's what Donald Trump thinks.
0	918.0		PENCE	Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.
0	919.0		PENCE	And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...
0	920.0		KAINE	But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
0	921.0		PENCE	and assurance to our allies.
0	922.0		PENCE	But let me go back to this Iran thing.
0	923.0		PENCE	I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0	924.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	925.0		KAINE	That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.
0	926.0		PENCE	Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks.
0	927.0		KAINE	Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.
0	928.0		PENCE	You wouldn't necessarily know that.
0	929.0		KAINE	Go to the tape.
0	930.0		PENCE	I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.
0	931.0		KAINE	No, I visited him in his office.
0	932.0		KAINE	I visited him in his office.
0	933.0		PENCE	You boycotted the speech.
0	934.0		PENCE	The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.
0	935.0		KAINE	And then Hillary used them to get a deal.
0	936.0		PENCE	We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.
0	937.0		KAINE	Elaine, let me just mention one thing.
0	938.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	939.0		PENCE	They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence.
0	940.0		PENCE	They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions.
0	941.0		PENCE	And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons.
0	942.0		PENCE	That...
0	943.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	944.0		QUIJANO	And very quickly, Senator.
0	945.0		KAINE	Elaine...
0	946.0		PENCE	and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...
0	947.0		QUIJANO	We need to talk about Russia.
0	948.0		QUIJANO	Very quickly, though, Senator, please.
0	949.0		PENCE	is astonishing to the American people.
0	950.0		KAINE	Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next.
0	951.0		KAINE	And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.
0	952.0		PENCE	Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth.
0	953.0		QUIJANO	All right.
0	954.0		PENCE	He's going...
0	955.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	956.0		KAINE	And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.
0	957.0		KAINE	And I just think that should be underlined.
0	958.0		PENCE	No, I'm -- look...
0	959.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	960.0		QUIJANO	All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia.
0	961.0		QUIJANO	This is a topic that has come up.
0	962.0		PENCE	I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump.
0	963.0		PENCE	If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.
0	964.0		QUIJANO	I will give you an opportunity to do that.
0	965.0		KAINE	More nations should get nuclear weapons.
0	966.0		KAINE	Try to defend that.
0	967.0		PENCE	Don't put words in my mouth.
0	968.0		PENCE	Well, he never said that, Senator.
0	969.0		KAINE	He absolutely said it.
0	970.0		KAINE	Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.
0	971.0		PENCE	Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.
0	972.0		QUIJANO	Gentlemen, Russia.
0	973.0		QUIJANO	Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime.
0	974.0		QUIJANO	What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?
0	975.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	976.0		KAINE	You've got to be tough on Russia.
0	977.0		KAINE	So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
0	978.0		KAINE	Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.
0	979.0		KAINE	And Donald Trump has business...
0	980.0		PENCE	No, we haven't.
0	981.0		KAINE	has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.
0	982.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.
0	983.0		KAINE	She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.
0	984.0		KAINE	She's had the experience doing it.
0	985.0		KAINE	She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.
0	986.0		KAINE	And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.
0	987.0		KAINE	Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.
0	988.0		PENCE	Oh, that's nonsense.
0	989.0		KAINE	"He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."""
0	990.0		KAINE	And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.
0	991.0		PENCE	He knew that.
0	992.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.
0	993.0		KAINE	She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.
0	994.0		KAINE	And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.
0	995.0		KAINE	You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.
0	996.0		KAINE	On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time.
0	997.0		KAINE	America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason.
0	998.0		KAINE	They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?
0	999.0		KAINE	Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do.
0	1000.0		KAINE	And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...
0	1001.0		PENCE	But what's it got to do with Russia?
0	1002.0		KAINE	Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia.
0	1003.0		KAINE	The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...
0	1004.0		PENCE	No, he hasn't said that.
0	1005.0		KAINE	He has, actually.
0	1006.0		QUIJANO	Senator, your time is up.
0	1007.0		QUIJANO	Governor?
0	1008.0		PENCE	Well, thanks.
0	1009.0		PENCE	I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.
0	1010.0		KAINE	You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.
0	1011.0		PENCE	Yeah.
0	1012.0		KAINE	And I know you can't defend.
0	1013.0		QUIJANO	Senator, please.
0	1014.0		QUIJANO	This is the governor's two minutes.
0	1015.0		PENCE	I'm happy to defend him, Senator.
0	1016.0		PENCE	Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.
0	1017.0		KAINE	You're not.
0	1018.0		PENCE	I'm happy to defend him.
0	1019.0		PENCE	Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.
0	1020.0		KAINE	I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...
0	1021.0		PENCE	This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.
0	1022.0		QUIJANO	Senator, please.
0	1023.0		QUIJANO	This is Governor Pence's two minutes.
0	1024.0		PENCE	Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality.
0	1025.0		PENCE	Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.
0	1026.0		PENCE	That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula.
0	1027.0		PENCE	Donald Trump knew that happened.
0	1028.0		PENCE	He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.
0	1029.0		PENCE	The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.
0	1030.0		PENCE	And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding.
0	1031.0		PENCE	You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.
0	1032.0		PENCE	ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.
0	1033.0		PENCE	It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure.
0	1034.0		PENCE	I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...
0	1035.0		KAINE	We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.
0	1036.0		PENCE	on the day that Iran released four American hostages...
0	1037.0		KAINE	We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0	1038.0		QUIJANO	Governor...
0	1039.0		PENCE	we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.
0	1040.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1041.0		QUIJANO	Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...
0	1042.0		KAINE	And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.
0	1043.0		QUIJANO	"quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."""
0	1044.0		QUIJANO	Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?
0	1045.0		PENCE	Strength.
0	1046.0		PENCE	Plain and simple.
0	1047.0		KAINE	Business dealings.
0	1048.0		PENCE	Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.
0	1049.0		PENCE	Donald Trump is a strong leader...
0	1050.0		KAINE	Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...
0	1051.0		PENCE	who is going to lead with American strength.
0	1052.0		QUIJANO	Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.
0	1053.0		PENCE	We're going to rebuild our military.
0	1054.0		PENCE	And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.
0	1055.0		PENCE	Look, America is stronger than Russia.
0	1056.0		PENCE	Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.
0	1057.0		PENCE	America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.
0	1058.0		PENCE	When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.
0	1059.0		PENCE	That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.
0	1060.0		PENCE	That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...
0	1061.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	1062.0		PENCE	of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
0	1063.0		KAINE	Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.
1	1064.0		KAINE	But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.
0	1065.0		PENCE	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0	1066.0		KAINE	And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...
0	1067.0		PENCE	He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.
0	1068.0		KAINE	No, he said leader.
0	1069.0		KAINE	And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor.
0	1070.0		PENCE	You just said better.
0	1071.0		KAINE	If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...
0	1072.0		PENCE	Yeah, here we go.
0	1073.0		PENCE	This is the grade school thing again?
0	1074.0		KAINE	persecuting journalists...
0	1075.0		PENCE	Right, this is grade school.
0	1076.0		KAINE	if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.
0	1077.0		PENCE	Yeah.
0	1078.0		KAINE	And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.
0	1079.0		KAINE	Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.
0	1080.0		KAINE	Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.
0	1081.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?
0	1082.0		KAINE	Vladimir Putin.
0	1083.0		KAINE	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
0	1084.0		QUIJANO	And what would do you differently?
0	1085.0		KAINE	Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
0	1086.0		KAINE	He's not a leader.
0	1087.0		KAINE	Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.
0	1088.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.
0	1089.0		KAINE	John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB.
0	1090.0		KAINE	And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.
0	1091.0		PENCE	Right.
0	1092.0		KAINE	So how do deal with him?
0	1093.0		KAINE	You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.
0	1094.0		KAINE	There are areas where we can cooperate.
0	1095.0		KAINE	So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.
0	1096.0		KAINE	It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.
0	1097.0		KAINE	She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.
0	1098.0		KAINE	But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.
0	1099.0		KAINE	This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
0	1100.0		QUIJANO	All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons.
0	1101.0		QUIJANO	North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.
0	1102.0		PENCE	Right.
0	1103.0		QUIJANO	What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?
0	1104.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	1105.0		PENCE	Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.
0	1106.0		PENCE	And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.
0	1107.0		PENCE	It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.
0	1108.0		PENCE	And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.
0	1109.0		PENCE	We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.
0	1110.0		PENCE	But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up.
0	1111.0		PENCE	It must have -- must have...
0	1112.0		KAINE	Until he...
0	1113.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1114.0		PENCE	done well in some focus group.
0	1115.0		PENCE	But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.
0	1116.0		PENCE	While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.
0	1117.0		PENCE	Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.
0	1118.0		PENCE	Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.
0	1119.0		PENCE	They cannot make financial contributions.
0	1120.0		PENCE	But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.
0	1121.0		PENCE	And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.
0	1122.0		PENCE	When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...
0	1123.0		QUIJANO	Governor, your two minutes are up.
0	1124.0		PENCE	the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...
0	1125.0		QUIJANO	Governor, please.
0	1126.0		PENCE	while she's secretary of state.
0	1127.0		QUIJANO	Your two minutes are up, Governor.
0	1128.0		PENCE	And they're saying enough is enough.
0	1129.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	1130.0		KAINE	I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea.
0	1131.0		KAINE	So, on the foundation.
0	1132.0		KAINE	I am glad to talk about the foundation.
0	1133.0		KAINE	The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.
0	1134.0		KAINE	It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.
0	1135.0		KAINE	It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.
0	1136.0		KAINE	It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.
0	1137.0		KAINE	The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.
0	1138.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.
0	1139.0		KAINE	The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.
0	1140.0		KAINE	So the foundation does good work.
0	1141.0		KAINE	And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.
0	1142.0		KAINE	But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.
0	1143.0		KAINE	The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.
0	1144.0		KAINE	He's refused to do it.
0	1145.0		KAINE	His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.
0	1146.0		KAINE	And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.
0	1147.0		KAINE	It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.
0	1148.0		PENCE	The Trump Foundation is non-profit.
0	1149.0		KAINE	In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.
0	1150.0		KAINE	The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.
0	1151.0		KAINE	They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.
0	1152.0		KAINE	And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.
0	1153.0		KAINE	This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.
0	1154.0		QUIJANO	Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.
0	1155.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1156.0		PENCE	Well, Thank you.
0	1157.0		PENCE	Thank you.
0	1158.0		PENCE	The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.
0	1159.0		PENCE	They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.
0	1160.0		KAINE	Political contributions?
0	1161.0		PENCE	Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
0	1162.0		KAINE	A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?
1	1163.0		PENCE	Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
0	1164.0		KAINE	Ninety percent.
0	1165.0		PENCE	It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.
1	1166.0		PENCE	But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...
0	1167.0		QUIJANO	All right, let's turn back to North Korea...
0	1168.0		PENCE	that she refused to turn over in her private server...
0	1169.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine...
0	1170.0		PENCE	and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.
0	1171.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?
0	1172.0		KAINE	If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.
0	1173.0		KAINE	You have to.
0	1174.0		KAINE	A president has to do that.
0	1175.0		KAINE	Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.
0	1176.0		KAINE	You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.
0	1177.0		KAINE	I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.
0	1178.0		KAINE	We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.
0	1179.0		KAINE	And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.
0	1180.0		KAINE	Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.
0	1181.0		KAINE	They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.
0	1182.0		KAINE	So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.
0	1183.0		KAINE	So we're working together with China, and we need to.
0	1184.0		KAINE	China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.
0	1185.0		KAINE	Hillary understands that very well.
0	1186.0		KAINE	"She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights."""
0	1187.0		KAINE	They didn't want her to say that, but she did.
0	1188.0		KAINE	But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.
0	1189.0		KAINE	And that's what it's going to take.
0	1190.0		KAINE	The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.
0	1191.0		KAINE	I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.
0	1192.0		QUIJANO	All right.
0	1193.0		QUIJANO	I'd like to turn to our next segment now.
0	1194.0		QUIJANO	And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.
0	1195.0		QUIJANO	You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.
0	1196.0		QUIJANO	Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?
0	1197.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine?
0	1198.0		KAINE	Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.
0	1199.0		KAINE	It's an easy one.
0	1200.0		KAINE	I'm really fortunate.
0	1201.0		KAINE	I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.
0	1202.0		KAINE	My mom and dad are sitting right here.
0	1203.0		KAINE	I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.
0	1204.0		KAINE	My 40th reunion is in 10 days.
0	1205.0		KAINE	And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.
0	1206.0		KAINE	I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.
0	1207.0		KAINE	But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.
0	1208.0		KAINE	For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.
0	1209.0		KAINE	But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.
0	1210.0		KAINE	And so I had to grapple with that.
0	1211.0		KAINE	When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.
0	1212.0		KAINE	But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.
0	1213.0		KAINE	I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.
0	1214.0		KAINE	And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.
0	1215.0		KAINE	And I was elected, and I did.
0	1216.0		KAINE	It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.
0	1217.0		KAINE	That was a real struggle.
0	1218.0		KAINE	But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.
0	1219.0		QUIJANO	Governor Pence?
0	1220.0		PENCE	Well, it's a wonderful question.
0	1221.0		PENCE	And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.
0	1222.0		PENCE	I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.
0	1223.0		PENCE	It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.
0	1224.0		PENCE	But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.
0	1225.0		PENCE	And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.
0	1226.0		PENCE	And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.
0	1227.0		PENCE	And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.
0	1228.0		PENCE	I truly do.
0	1229.0		KAINE	That's shared.
0	1230.0		PENCE	But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.
0	1231.0		PENCE	The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.
0	1232.0		PENCE	I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.
0	1233.0		PENCE	I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.
1	1234.0		PENCE	But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.
0	1235.0		PENCE	I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.
0	1236.0		PENCE	And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.
0	1237.0		PENCE	Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.
0	1238.0		PENCE	But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.
0	1239.0		PENCE	So for me, my faith informs my life.
0	1240.0		PENCE	I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.
0	1241.0		PENCE	But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.
0	1242.0		KAINE	Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.
0	1243.0		KAINE	Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.
0	1244.0		KAINE	But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.
0	1245.0		KAINE	But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.
0	1246.0		KAINE	So let's talk about abortion and choice.
0	1247.0		KAINE	Let's talk about them.
0	1248.0		KAINE	We support Roe v. Wade.
0	1249.0		KAINE	We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.
0	1250.0		KAINE	That's something we trust American women to do that.
0	1251.0		KAINE	And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.
0	1252.0		KAINE	Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.
0	1253.0		KAINE	He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.
0	1254.0		KAINE	And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.
0	1255.0		KAINE	This is pretty important.
0	1256.0		KAINE	Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.
0	1257.0		KAINE	I think you should live your moral values.
0	1258.0		KAINE	But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.
0	1259.0		KAINE	And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.
0	1260.0		PENCE	No, it's really not.
0	1261.0		PENCE	Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.
0	1262.0		KAINE	Then why did Donald Trump say that?
0	1263.0		PENCE	We just never would.
0	1264.0		KAINE	Why did he say that?
0	1265.0		PENCE	Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.
0	1266.0		PENCE	And so...
0	1267.0		KAINE	Well, I would admit that's not a polished...
0	1268.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1269.0		PENCE	You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.
0	1270.0		KAINE	Well, can I say...
0	1271.0		PENCE	But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.
0	1272.0		KAINE	Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.
0	1273.0		KAINE	From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.
0	1274.0		PENCE	Yeah.
0	1275.0		KAINE	When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...
0	1276.0		PENCE	I'm telling you...
0	1277.0		KAINE	or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.
0	1278.0		PENCE	Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again.
0	1279.0		PENCE	He -- look...
0	1280.0		KAINE	Can you defend it?
0	1281.0		PENCE	There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.
0	1282.0		KAINE	You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?
0	1283.0		PENCE	He also said and many of them are good people.
0	1284.0		PENCE	You keep leaving that out of your quote.
0	1285.0		PENCE	And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.
0	1286.0		PENCE	But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life.
0	1287.0		PENCE	I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.
0	1288.0		PENCE	It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.
0	1289.0		PENCE	And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.
0	1290.0		PENCE	People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.
0	1291.0		PENCE	We can create a culture of life.
0	1292.0		PENCE	More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.
0	1293.0		PENCE	We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...
0	1294.0		KAINE	This is important --
0	1295.0		PENCE	bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.
0	1296.0		PENCE	There are so many families around the country who can't have children.
0	1297.0		PENCE	We could improve adoption...
0	1298.0		KAINE	But, Governor...
0	1299.0		PENCE	so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.
0	1300.0		KAINE	Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?
0	1301.0		KAINE	We can encourage people to support life.
0	1302.0		KAINE	Of course we can.
0	1303.0		KAINE	But why don't you trust women?
0	1304.0		KAINE	Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?
0	1305.0		KAINE	That's what we ought to be doing in public life.
0	1306.0		KAINE	Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...
0	1307.0		PENCE	Because there are...
0	1308.0		KAINE	but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.
0	1309.0		PENCE	Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.
0	1310.0		PENCE	I believe it with all my heart.
0	1311.0		PENCE	And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.
0	1312.0		QUIJANO	I do have one final question for you both tonight.
0	1313.0		QUIJANO	It has been a divisive campaign.
0	1314.0		QUIJANO	Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?
0	1315.0		KAINE	That's a really important one.
0	1316.0		KAINE	That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.
0	1317.0		KAINE	And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.
0	1318.0		KAINE	But we do have to bring the country together.
0	1319.0		KAINE	So here's what we'll do.
0	1320.0		KAINE	Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.
0	1321.0		KAINE	And I served in the Senate.
0	1322.0		KAINE	And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.
0	1323.0		KAINE	She was on the Armed Services Committee.
0	1324.0		KAINE	She was on other committees.
0	1325.0		KAINE	She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.
0	1326.0		KAINE	She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.
0	1327.0		KAINE	She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.
0	1328.0		KAINE	She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.
0	1329.0		KAINE	And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.
0	1330.0		KAINE	I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.
0	1331.0		KAINE	And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.
0	1332.0		KAINE	Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.
0	1333.0		KAINE	And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.
0	1334.0		QUIJANO	Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?
0	1335.0		PENCE	Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...
0	1336.0		KAINE	Absolutely.
0	1337.0		PENCE	tonight.
0	1338.0		PENCE	Thank you, Senator.
0	1339.0		PENCE	This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.
0	1340.0		PENCE	Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.
0	1341.0		PENCE	I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.
0	1342.0		PENCE	You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.
0	1343.0		PENCE	And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill.
0	1344.0		PENCE	The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.
0	1345.0		PENCE	The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.
0	1346.0		PENCE	They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.
0	1347.0		PENCE	They want to see an American comeback.
0	1348.0		PENCE	And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.
0	1349.0		PENCE	It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.
0	1350.0		PENCE	When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.
0	1351.0		PENCE	They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.
0	1352.0		PENCE	And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.
0	1353.0		QUIJANO	All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.
0	1354.0		QUIJANO	This concludes the vice presidential debate.
0	1355.0		QUIJANO	My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching.
0	1356.0		QUIJANO	Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
0	1357.0		QUIJANO	From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News.
0	1358.0		QUIJANO	Good night.
0	1.0		RADDATZ	Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.
0	2.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	3.0		COOPER	Thank you very much for being here.
0	4.0		COOPER	We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.
0	5.0		COOPER	Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.
0	6.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.
0	7.0		COOPER	Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.
0	8.0		COOPER	Patrice?
0	9.0		QUESTION	Thank you, and good evening.
0	10.0		QUESTION	The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.
0	11.0		QUESTION	Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?
0	12.0		CLINTON	Well, thank you.
0	13.0		CLINTON	Are you a teacher?
0	14.0		CLINTON	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.
0	15.0		CLINTON	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.
0	16.0		CLINTON	And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.
0	17.0		CLINTON	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.
0	18.0		CLINTON	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.
0	19.0		CLINTON	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."
0	20.0		CLINTON	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.
0	21.0		CLINTON	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.
0	22.0		CLINTON	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.
0	23.0		CLINTON	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.
0	24.0		CLINTON	I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.
0	25.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
0	26.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
0	27.0		TRUMP	Well, I actually agree with that.
0	28.0		TRUMP	I agree with everything she said.
0	29.0		TRUMP	I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.
0	30.0		TRUMP	This is a great country.
0	31.0		TRUMP	This is a great land.
0	32.0		TRUMP	I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.
0	33.0		TRUMP	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.
0	34.0		TRUMP	And my whole concept was to make America great again.
1	35.0		TRUMP	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.
0	36.0		TRUMP	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.
1	37.0		TRUMP	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.
0	38.0		TRUMP	In other words, trading with other countries.
1	39.0		TRUMP	We had an $800 billion deficit.
0	40.0		TRUMP	It's hard to believe.
0	41.0		TRUMP	Inconceivable.
0	42.0		TRUMP	You say who's making these deals?
0	43.0		TRUMP	We're going the make great deals.
0	44.0		TRUMP	We're going to have a strong border.
0	45.0		TRUMP	We're going to bring back law and order.
0	46.0		TRUMP	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.
0	47.0		TRUMP	And this is happening on a weekly basis.
0	48.0		TRUMP	We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.
0	49.0		TRUMP	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.
0	50.0		TRUMP	We need justice.
0	51.0		TRUMP	But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.
0	52.0		TRUMP	It's called make America great again.
0	53.0		COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	54.0		COOPER	The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?
0	55.0		COOPER	We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine.
0	56.0		COOPER	You called what you said locker room banter.
0	57.0		COOPER	You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.
0	58.0		COOPER	That is sexual assault.
0	59.0		COOPER	You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.
0	60.0		COOPER	Do you understand that?
0	61.0		TRUMP	No, I didn't say that at all.
0	62.0		TRUMP	I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.
0	63.0		TRUMP	I'm not proud of it.
0	64.0		TRUMP	I apologize to my family.
0	65.0		TRUMP	I apologize to the American people.
0	66.0		TRUMP	Certainly I'm not proud of it.
0	67.0		TRUMP	But this is locker room talk.
0	68.0		TRUMP	You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.
0	69.0		TRUMP	We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.
0	70.0		TRUMP	And they look and they see.
0	71.0		TRUMP	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?
0	72.0		TRUMP	And they look at our country and they see what's going on.
0	73.0		TRUMP	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.
0	74.0		TRUMP	I hate it.
0	75.0		TRUMP	But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.
0	76.0		TRUMP	I will knock the hell out of ISIS.
0	77.0		TRUMP	We're going to defeat ISIS.
0	78.0		TRUMP	ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.
0	79.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.
0	80.0		COOPER	So, Mr. Trump...
0	81.0		TRUMP	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
0	82.0		COOPER	Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?
0	83.0		TRUMP	I have great respect for women.
0	84.0		TRUMP	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
0	85.0		COOPER	So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?
0	86.0		TRUMP	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.
0	87.0		TRUMP	And I was embarrassed by it.
0	88.0		TRUMP	But I have tremendous respect for women.
0	89.0		COOPER	Have you ever done those things?
0	90.0		TRUMP	And women have respect for me.
0	91.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you: No, I have not.
0	92.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.
0	93.0		TRUMP	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.
0	94.0		TRUMP	People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.
0	95.0		TRUMP	We're going to make America safe again.
0	96.0		TRUMP	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.
0	97.0		TRUMP	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.
0	98.0		COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	99.0		TRUMP	Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.
0	100.0		COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	101.0		TRUMP	And that's what I want to talk about.
0	102.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?
0	103.0		CLINTON	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.
0	104.0		CLINTON	You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.
0	105.0		CLINTON	Donald Trump is different.
0	106.0		CLINTON	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.
0	107.0		CLINTON	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.
0	108.0		CLINTON	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.
0	109.0		CLINTON	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
0	110.0		CLINTON	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
0	111.0		CLINTON	Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.
0	112.0		CLINTON	We have seen him insult women.
0	113.0		CLINTON	We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.
0	114.0		CLINTON	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.
0	115.0		CLINTON	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.
0	116.0		CLINTON	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.
0	117.0		CLINTON	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
0	118.0		CLINTON	So this is who Donald Trump is.
0	119.0		CLINTON	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.
0	120.0		CLINTON	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.
0	121.0		CLINTON	These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.
0	122.0		CLINTON	And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
0	123.0		RADDATZ	And we want to get to some questions from online...
0	124.0		TRUMP	Am I allowed to respond to that?
0	125.0		TRUMP	I assume I am.
0	126.0		RADDATZ	Yes, you can respond to that.
0	127.0		TRUMP	It's just words, folks.
0	128.0		TRUMP	It's just words.
0	129.0		TRUMP	Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.
0	130.0		TRUMP	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.
0	131.0		TRUMP	I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.
0	132.0		TRUMP	I'm going to help the African-Americans.
0	133.0		TRUMP	I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.
0	134.0		TRUMP	I am going to help the inner cities.
0	135.0		TRUMP	She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.
0	136.0		TRUMP	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.
0	137.0		TRUMP	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.
0	138.0		TRUMP	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...
0	139.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.
0	140.0		TRUMP	So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?
0	141.0		RADDATZ	You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.
0	142.0		TRUMP	Sounds fair.
0	143.0		RADDATZ	This tape is generating intense interest.
0	144.0		RADDATZ	In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.
0	145.0		RADDATZ	As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.
0	146.0		RADDATZ	"Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him."
0	147.0		RADDATZ	"When did that happen?"""
0	148.0		RADDATZ	So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.
0	149.0		RADDATZ	When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?
0	150.0		RADDATZ	And you have two minutes for this.
0	151.0		TRUMP	It was locker room talk, as I told you.
0	152.0		TRUMP	That was locker room talk.
0	153.0		TRUMP	I'm not proud of it.
0	154.0		TRUMP	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.
0	155.0		TRUMP	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.
0	156.0		TRUMP	But that was something that happened.
0	157.0		TRUMP	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
0	158.0		TRUMP	Mine are words, and his was action.
0	159.0		TRUMP	His was what he's done to women.
0	160.0		TRUMP	There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
1	161.0		TRUMP	So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
0	162.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
0	163.0		TRUMP	Four of them here tonight.
1	164.0		TRUMP	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.
1	165.0		TRUMP	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.
0	166.0		TRUMP	Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.
0	167.0		TRUMP	So don't tell me about words.
0	168.0		TRUMP	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.
0	169.0		TRUMP	But it is things that people say.
0	170.0		TRUMP	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.
0	171.0		TRUMP	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.
0	172.0		TRUMP	Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
0	173.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.
0	174.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	175.0		RADDATZ	Can we please hold the applause?
0	176.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
0	177.0		CLINTON	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
0	178.0		CLINTON	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.
0	179.0		CLINTON	Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.
0	180.0		CLINTON	When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.
0	181.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	182.0		CLINTON	And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.
0	183.0		CLINTON	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.
0	184.0		CLINTON	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.
0	185.0		CLINTON	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.
0	186.0		CLINTON	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""
0	187.0		CLINTON	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.
0	188.0		CLINTON	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.
0	189.0		CLINTON	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.
1	190.0		TRUMP	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.
0	191.0		TRUMP	So you really owe him an apology.
0	192.0		TRUMP	You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.
0	193.0		TRUMP	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.
0	194.0		TRUMP	Number two, Michelle Obama.
0	195.0		TRUMP	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.
0	196.0		TRUMP	And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.
0	197.0		TRUMP	So, you talk about friend?
0	198.0		TRUMP	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.
0	199.0		TRUMP	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.
0	200.0		TRUMP	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.
0	201.0		TRUMP	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.
0	202.0		TRUMP	And I'll tell you what.
0	203.0		TRUMP	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.
0	204.0		TRUMP	But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.
0	205.0		TRUMP	There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.
0	206.0		TRUMP	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.
0	207.0		TRUMP	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.
1	208.0		TRUMP	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.
0	209.0		TRUMP	So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?
0	210.0		TRUMP	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.
0	211.0		TRUMP	And it's a disgrace.
0	212.0		TRUMP	And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
0	213.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.
0	214.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	215.0		RADDATZ	I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.
0	216.0		CLINTON	because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.
0	217.0		TRUMP	Oh, really?
0	218.0		CLINTON	In the first debate...
0	219.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	220.0		RADDATZ	And really, the audience needs to calm down here.
0	221.0		CLINTON	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.
0	222.0		CLINTON	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.
0	223.0		CLINTON	So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.
0	224.0		CLINTON	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.
0	225.0		CLINTON	Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
0	226.0		TRUMP	Because you'd be in jail.
0	227.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	228.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton...
0	229.0		COOPER	We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.
0	230.0		COOPER	Please do not applaud.
0	231.0		COOPER	You're just wasting time.
0	232.0		RADDATZ	And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.
0	233.0		RADDATZ	You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.
0	234.0		RADDATZ	"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."""
0	235.0		RADDATZ	The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.
0	236.0		RADDATZ	You don't call that extremely careless?
0	237.0		CLINTON	Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.
0	238.0		CLINTON	Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.
0	239.0		CLINTON	I'm not making any excuses.
0	240.0		CLINTON	It was a mistake.
0	241.0		CLINTON	And I am very sorry about that.
0	242.0		CLINTON	But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.
1	243.0		CLINTON	After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.
0	244.0		CLINTON	I take classified materials very seriously and always have.
0	245.0		CLINTON	When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.
0	246.0		CLINTON	Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.
0	247.0		CLINTON	So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.
0	248.0		CLINTON	And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.
0	249.0		RADDATZ	OK, we're going to move on.
0	250.0		TRUMP	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.
0	251.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	252.0		TRUMP	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.
0	253.0		TRUMP	You know, it's amazing.
0	254.0		TRUMP	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.
0	255.0		TRUMP	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.
0	256.0		TRUMP	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?
0	257.0		TRUMP	I don't think so.
0	258.0		TRUMP	She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.
0	259.0		TRUMP	Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.
0	260.0		TRUMP	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.
0	261.0		TRUMP	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.
0	262.0		TRUMP	That wasn't before.
0	263.0		TRUMP	That was after.
0	264.0		TRUMP	She got it from the United States Congress.
0	265.0		TRUMP	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.
0	266.0		TRUMP	Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.
0	267.0		TRUMP	But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.
0	268.0		TRUMP	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
0	269.0		COOPER	We have to move on.
0	270.0		TRUMP	You did that.
0	271.0		TRUMP	Wait a minute.
0	272.0		TRUMP	One second.
0	273.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.
0	274.0		RADDATZ	We want to give the audience a chance.
0	275.0		TRUMP	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
0	276.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you can respond.
0	277.0		COOPER	Then we have to move on to an audience question.
0	278.0		CLINTON	Look, it's just not true.
0	279.0		CLINTON	And so please, go to...
0	280.0		TRUMP	Oh, you didn't delete them?
0	281.0		COOPER	Allow her to respond, please.
0	282.0		CLINTON	It was personal e-mails, not official.
0	283.0		TRUMP	Oh, 33,000?
0	284.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	285.0		CLINTON	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...
0	286.0		TRUMP	Oh, yeah.
0	287.0		TRUMP	What about the other 15,000?
0	288.0		COOPER	Please allow her to respond.
0	289.0		COOPER	She didn't talk while you talked.
0	290.0		CLINTON	Yes, that's true, I didn't.
0	291.0		TRUMP	Because you have nothing to say.
0	292.0		CLINTON	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.
0	293.0		TRUMP	Get off this question.
0	294.0		CLINTON	OK, Donald.
0	295.0		CLINTON	I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.
0	296.0		CLINTON	But let's at least focus...
0	297.0		TRUMP	Let's see what happens...
0	298.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	299.0		COOPER	Allow her to respond.
0	300.0		CLINTON	on some of the issues that people care about tonight.
0	301.0		CLINTON	Let's get to their questions.
0	302.0		COOPER	We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.
0	303.0		COOPER	He has a question about health care.
0	304.0		COOPER	Ken?
0	305.0		TRUMP	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?
0	306.0		TRUMP	I'd like to know.
0	307.0		TRUMP	Why aren't you bringing...
0	308.0		COOPER	We brought up the e-mails.
0	309.0		TRUMP	No, it hasn't.
0	310.0		TRUMP	It hasn't.
0	311.0		TRUMP	And it hasn't been finished at all.
0	312.0		COOPER	Ken Karpowicz has a question.
0	313.0		TRUMP	It's nice to -- one on three.
0	314.0		QUESTION	Thank you.
0	315.0		QUESTION	Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.
0	316.0		QUESTION	Premiums have gone up.
0	317.0		QUESTION	Deductibles have gone up.
0	318.0		QUESTION	Copays have gone up.
0	319.0		QUESTION	Prescriptions have gone up.
0	320.0		QUESTION	And the coverage has gone down.
0	321.0		QUESTION	What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?
0	322.0		COOPER	That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.
0	323.0		CLINTON	If he wants to start, he can start.
0	324.0		CLINTON	No, go ahead, Donald.
0	325.0		TRUMP	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.
0	326.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	327.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	328.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton?
0	329.0		CLINTON	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.
0	330.0		CLINTON	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.
0	331.0		CLINTON	Premiums have gotten too high.
0	332.0		CLINTON	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.
0	333.0		CLINTON	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.
0	334.0		CLINTON	But that in and of itself was a good thing.
0	335.0		CLINTON	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.
0	336.0		CLINTON	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.
0	337.0		CLINTON	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
0	338.0		CLINTON	Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.
0	339.0		CLINTON	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.
1	340.0		CLINTON	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.
0	341.0		CLINTON	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.
0	342.0		CLINTON	But we've got to get costs down.
0	343.0		CLINTON	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.
0	344.0		CLINTON	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.
0	345.0		CLINTON	And then we would have to start all over again.
0	346.0		CLINTON	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.
0	347.0		CLINTON	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.
0	348.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, your time is up.
0	349.0		CLINTON	So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.
0	350.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
0	351.0		TRUMP	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.
0	352.0		TRUMP	Obamacare is a disaster.
0	353.0		TRUMP	You know it.
0	354.0		TRUMP	We all know it.
0	355.0		TRUMP	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.
0	356.0		TRUMP	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.
0	357.0		TRUMP	It's only getting worse.
0	358.0		TRUMP	In '17, it implodes by itself.
0	359.0		TRUMP	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.
0	360.0		TRUMP	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.
0	361.0		TRUMP	Obamacare will never work.
0	362.0		TRUMP	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.
0	363.0		TRUMP	Far too expensive.
0	364.0		TRUMP	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.
0	365.0		TRUMP	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
0	366.0		TRUMP	We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.
0	367.0		TRUMP	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.
0	368.0		TRUMP	We want competition.
0	369.0		TRUMP	You will have the finest health care plan there is.
1	370.0		TRUMP	She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.
0	371.0		TRUMP	And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.
0	372.0		TRUMP	It's catastrophic in certain ways.
0	373.0		TRUMP	But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.
0	374.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.
0	375.0		TRUMP	Obamacare was the first step.
0	376.0		TRUMP	Obamacare is a total disaster.
0	377.0		TRUMP	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.
0	378.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, your time...
0	379.0		TRUMP	It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.
0	380.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.
0	381.0		COOPER	"Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half."
0	382.0		COOPER	Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?
0	383.0		CLINTON	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.
0	384.0		CLINTON	And it's very clear.
0	385.0		CLINTON	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.
0	386.0		CLINTON	But we have an employer-based system.
0	387.0		CLINTON	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.
0	388.0		CLINTON	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.
0	389.0		CLINTON	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.
0	390.0		CLINTON	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.
0	391.0		CLINTON	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.
0	392.0		CLINTON	So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...
0	393.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton...
0	394.0		CLINTON	get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...
0	395.0		COOPER	Your time is up.
0	396.0		CLINTON	you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.
0	397.0		CLINTON	So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0	398.0		CLINTON	That's not going to work.
0	399.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.
0	400.0		TRUMP	Well, I just want -- just one thing.
0	401.0		TRUMP	First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.
0	402.0		TRUMP	Everything.
0	403.0		TRUMP	Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.
0	404.0		TRUMP	This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.
0	405.0		COOPER	You've said you want to end Obamacare...
0	406.0		TRUMP	By the way...
0	407.0		COOPER	You've said you want to end Obamacare.
0	408.0		COOPER	You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.
0	409.0		COOPER	How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?
0	410.0		TRUMP	We're going to be able to.
0	411.0		TRUMP	You're going to have plans...
0	412.0		COOPER	What does that mean?
0	413.0		TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you what it means.
0	414.0		TRUMP	You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.
0	415.0		TRUMP	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...
0	416.0		COOPER	Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?
0	417.0		TRUMP	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.
0	418.0		TRUMP	President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.
0	419.0		TRUMP	You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.
0	420.0		TRUMP	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.
0	421.0		TRUMP	The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.
0	422.0		TRUMP	But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.
0	423.0		TRUMP	And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.
0	424.0		TRUMP	We're going to block grant into the states.
0	425.0		TRUMP	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...
0	426.0		COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	427.0		TRUMP	so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
0	428.0		COOPER	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	429.0		RADDATZ	We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.
0	430.0		QUESTION	Hi.
0	431.0		QUESTION	There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.
0	432.0		QUESTION	You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?
0	433.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, you're first.
0	434.0		TRUMP	Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.
0	435.0		TRUMP	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.
0	436.0		TRUMP	I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.
0	437.0		TRUMP	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.
0	438.0		TRUMP	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.
1	439.0		TRUMP	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.
0	440.0		TRUMP	Horribly wounded.
0	441.0		TRUMP	They'll never be the same.
0	442.0		TRUMP	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.
0	443.0		TRUMP	And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.
0	444.0		TRUMP	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.
0	445.0		TRUMP	Go outside.
0	446.0		TRUMP	Look at Paris.
0	447.0		TRUMP	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.
0	448.0		TRUMP	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.
0	449.0		TRUMP	"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""
0	450.0		TRUMP	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.
0	451.0		TRUMP	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.
0	452.0		TRUMP	But the name is there.
0	453.0		TRUMP	It's radical Islamic terror.
0	454.0		TRUMP	And before you solve it, you have to say the name.
0	455.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton?
0	456.0		CLINTON	Well, thank you for asking your question.
0	457.0		CLINTON	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.
0	458.0		CLINTON	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.
0	459.0		CLINTON	I want to say just a couple of things.
0	460.0		CLINTON	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.
0	461.0		CLINTON	And we've had many successful Muslims.
0	462.0		CLINTON	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.
0	463.0		CLINTON	My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.
0	464.0		CLINTON	That's what America is.
0	465.0		CLINTON	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.
0	466.0		CLINTON	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.
0	467.0		CLINTON	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.
0	468.0		CLINTON	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.
0	469.0		CLINTON	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.
0	470.0		CLINTON	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.
0	471.0		CLINTON	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?
0	472.0		CLINTON	And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.
0	473.0		CLINTON	We are not at war with Islam.
0	474.0		CLINTON	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.
0	475.0		CLINTON	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.
0	476.0		RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	477.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, in December, you said this.
0	478.0		RADDATZ	Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
0	479.0		RADDATZ	We have no choice.
0	480.0		RADDATZ	We have no choice.
0	481.0		RADDATZ	Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.
0	482.0		RADDATZ	Is that correct?
0	483.0		RADDATZ	And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?
0	484.0		TRUMP	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.
0	485.0		TRUMP	Iraq was disaster.
0	486.0		TRUMP	So he would have been alive today.
0	487.0		TRUMP	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.
0	488.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.
0	489.0		TRUMP	Excuse me..
0	490.0		RADDATZ	And why did it morph into that?
0	491.0		RADDATZ	No, did you -- no, answer the question.
0	492.0		RADDATZ	Do you still believe...
0	493.0		TRUMP	Why don't you interrupt her?
0	494.0		TRUMP	You interrupt me all the time.
0	495.0		RADDATZ	I do.
0	496.0		TRUMP	Why don't you interrupt her?
0	497.0		RADDATZ	Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?
0	498.0		TRUMP	It's called extreme vetting.
0	499.0		TRUMP	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.
0	500.0		TRUMP	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.
0	501.0		TRUMP	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.
0	502.0		TRUMP	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
0	503.0		TRUMP	We have enough problems in this country.
0	504.0		TRUMP	I believe in building safe zones.
0	505.0		TRUMP	I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.
0	506.0		TRUMP	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.
0	507.0		TRUMP	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.
0	508.0		RADDATZ	And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.
0	509.0		RADDATZ	We know you want tougher vetting.
0	510.0		RADDATZ	That's not a perfect system.
0	511.0		RADDATZ	So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?
0	512.0		CLINTON	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.
0	513.0		CLINTON	But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.
0	514.0		CLINTON	There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.
0	515.0		CLINTON	And we need to do our part.
0	516.0		CLINTON	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.
0	517.0		CLINTON	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.
0	518.0		CLINTON	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.
0	519.0		CLINTON	How do you do that?
0	520.0		CLINTON	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.
0	521.0		CLINTON	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?
0	522.0		CLINTON	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?
0	523.0		CLINTON	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?
0	524.0		CLINTON	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.
0	525.0		CLINTON	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.
0	526.0		CLINTON	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.
0	527.0		CLINTON	We have it on tape.
0	528.0		CLINTON	The entire press corps has looked at it.
0	529.0		CLINTON	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.
0	530.0		TRUMP	That's not been debunked.
0	531.0		CLINTON	So, please...
0	532.0		TRUMP	That has not been debunked.
0	533.0		CLINTON	go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.
1	534.0		TRUMP	I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.
0	535.0		TRUMP	Has not been debunked.
0	536.0		TRUMP	And you voted for it.
0	537.0		TRUMP	And you shouldn't have.
0	538.0		TRUMP	Well, I just want to say...
0	539.0		RADDATZ	There's been lots of fact-checking on that.
0	540.0		RADDATZ	I'd like to move on to an online question...
0	541.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	542.0		TRUMP	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
0	543.0		RADDATZ	She did not.
0	544.0		TRUMP	Could I just respond to this, please?
0	545.0		RADDATZ	Very quickly, please.
0	546.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.
0	547.0		TRUMP	When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.
0	548.0		TRUMP	In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.
0	549.0		TRUMP	And they don't want them.
0	550.0		TRUMP	And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.
0	551.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.
0	552.0		TRUMP	They're murderers and some very bad people.
0	553.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.
0	554.0		TRUMP	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.
0	555.0		TRUMP	At a record clip.
0	556.0		TRUMP	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
0	557.0		TRUMP	ICE just endorsed me.
0	558.0		TRUMP	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.
0	559.0		TRUMP	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.
0	560.0		TRUMP	She doesn't.
0	561.0		TRUMP	She wants amnesty for everybody.
0	562.0		TRUMP	Come right in.
0	563.0		TRUMP	Come right over.
0	564.0		TRUMP	It's a horrible thing she's doing.
0	565.0		TRUMP	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.
0	566.0		TRUMP	That I can tell you.
0	567.0		RADDATZ	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	568.0		RADDATZ	I want to move on.
0	569.0		RADDATZ	This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes.
0	570.0		RADDATZ	This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.
0	571.0		RADDATZ	So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?
0	572.0		RADDATZ	Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?
0	573.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.
0	574.0		CLINTON	Well, right.
0	575.0		CLINTON	"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""
0	576.0		CLINTON	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.
0	577.0		CLINTON	It was principled, and it was strategic.
0	578.0		CLINTON	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.
0	579.0		CLINTON	And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.
0	580.0		CLINTON	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.
0	581.0		CLINTON	But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.
0	582.0		CLINTON	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.
0	583.0		CLINTON	We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.
0	584.0		CLINTON	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.
0	585.0		CLINTON	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.
0	586.0		CLINTON	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.
0	587.0		CLINTON	But we deserve answers.
0	588.0		CLINTON	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...
0	589.0		RADDATZ	We're going to get to that later.
0	590.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you're out of time.
0	591.0		CLINTON	with the Russians and other foreign powers.
0	592.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?
0	593.0		TRUMP	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.
0	594.0		TRUMP	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.
0	595.0		TRUMP	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.
0	596.0		TRUMP	And she lied.
0	597.0		TRUMP	Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.
0	598.0		TRUMP	That's one that I haven't...
0	599.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	600.0		TRUMP	OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.
0	601.0		TRUMP	That's the good thing.
0	602.0		TRUMP	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.
0	603.0		TRUMP	That's a big, big difference.
0	604.0		TRUMP	We're talking about some difference.
0	605.0		TRUMP	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.
0	606.0		TRUMP	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.
0	607.0		TRUMP	But I don't know Putin.
1	608.0		TRUMP	But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.
0	609.0		TRUMP	Maybe there is no hacking.
0	610.0		TRUMP	But they always blame Russia.
0	611.0		TRUMP	And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.
0	612.0		TRUMP	I know nothing about Russia.
0	613.0		TRUMP	I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.
0	614.0		TRUMP	I don't deal there.
0	615.0		TRUMP	I have no businesses there.
0	616.0		TRUMP	I have no loans from Russia.
0	617.0		TRUMP	I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.
0	618.0		TRUMP	One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.
0	619.0		TRUMP	But I have no loans with Russia.
0	620.0		TRUMP	You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.
0	621.0		TRUMP	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.
0	622.0		TRUMP	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
0	623.0		TRUMP	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.
0	624.0		TRUMP	Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.
0	625.0		TRUMP	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.
0	626.0		TRUMP	Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.
0	627.0		TRUMP	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
0	628.0		TRUMP	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.
0	629.0		TRUMP	I'll be very proud to.
0	630.0		TRUMP	They're actually quite great.
0	631.0		RADDATZ	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0	632.0		COOPER	We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes.
0	633.0		COOPER	We have a question from Spencer Maass.
0	634.0		COOPER	Spencer?
0	635.0		QUESTION	Good evening.
0	636.0		QUESTION	My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?
0	637.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
0	638.0		TRUMP	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.
0	639.0		TRUMP	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.
0	640.0		TRUMP	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.
0	641.0		TRUMP	She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.
0	642.0		TRUMP	She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.
0	643.0		TRUMP	Well, why didn't she change it?
0	644.0		TRUMP	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?
0	645.0		TRUMP	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.
0	646.0		TRUMP	And I do.
0	647.0		TRUMP	You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.
0	648.0		TRUMP	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.
0	649.0		TRUMP	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.
0	650.0		TRUMP	You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.
0	651.0		TRUMP	I wish you would have done this.
0	652.0		TRUMP	But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.
0	653.0		TRUMP	She never changed.
0	654.0		TRUMP	And she never will change.
0	655.0		TRUMP	She never will change.
0	656.0		TRUMP	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.
0	657.0		TRUMP	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.
0	658.0		TRUMP	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.
0	659.0		TRUMP	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.
0	660.0		TRUMP	We're cutting taxes for the middle class.
0	661.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.
1	662.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.
0	663.0		TRUMP	You can look at me.
1	664.0		TRUMP	She's raising your taxes really high.
0	665.0		TRUMP	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.
1	666.0		TRUMP	But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.
0	667.0		TRUMP	That in itself is a big difference.
0	668.0		TRUMP	We are going to be thriving again.
0	669.0		TRUMP	We have no growth in this country.
0	670.0		TRUMP	There's no growth.
0	671.0		TRUMP	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.
0	672.0		TRUMP	We're down at 1 percent.
0	673.0		TRUMP	And that's, like, no growth.
0	674.0		TRUMP	And we're going lower, in my opinion.
0	675.0		TRUMP	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.
0	676.0		TRUMP	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.
0	677.0		TRUMP	And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.
1	678.0		TRUMP	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
0	679.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
0	680.0		COOPER	The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?
0	681.0		CLINTON	Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.
0	682.0		CLINTON	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.
0	683.0		CLINTON	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.
0	684.0		CLINTON	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.
0	685.0		CLINTON	His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.
0	686.0		CLINTON	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.
1	687.0		CLINTON	And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.
0	688.0		CLINTON	Now, here's what I want to do.
0	689.0		CLINTON	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.
0	690.0		CLINTON	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.
0	691.0		CLINTON	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.
0	692.0		CLINTON	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.
0	693.0		CLINTON	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.
0	694.0		CLINTON	It's called the Buffett rule.
0	695.0		CLINTON	Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.
0	696.0		CLINTON	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.
0	697.0		CLINTON	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.
0	698.0		CLINTON	I want to invest in hard-working families.
1	699.0		CLINTON	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.
0	700.0		CLINTON	And we need to reverse that.
0	701.0		CLINTON	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.
0	702.0		COOPER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	703.0		CLINTON	And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.
0	704.0		COOPER	Thank you.
0	705.0		COOPER	I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.
0	706.0		COOPER	I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.
0	707.0		COOPER	In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.
0	708.0		COOPER	The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.
0	709.0		COOPER	They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.
0	710.0		COOPER	You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.
0	711.0		COOPER	You have not answered, though, a simple question.
0	712.0		COOPER	Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?
0	713.0		TRUMP	Of course I do.
0	714.0		TRUMP	Of course I do.
0	715.0		TRUMP	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.
0	716.0		TRUMP	I know many of her donors.
0	717.0		TRUMP	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.
0	718.0		COOPER	So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?
0	719.0		TRUMP	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.
0	720.0		TRUMP	And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.
0	721.0		TRUMP	That's why.
0	722.0		TRUMP	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.
0	723.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.
0	724.0		TRUMP	But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.
0	725.0		TRUMP	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.
0	726.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.
0	727.0		TRUMP	I absolutely used it.
0	728.0		TRUMP	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.
0	729.0		TRUMP	Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.
0	730.0		TRUMP	So we won't make them famous.
0	731.0		COOPER	So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?
0	732.0		TRUMP	No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.
0	733.0		TRUMP	But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.
0	734.0		TRUMP	I love depreciation.
0	735.0		TRUMP	You know, she's given it to us.
0	736.0		TRUMP	Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.
0	737.0		TRUMP	I say it all the time.
0	738.0		TRUMP	She talks about health care.
0	739.0		TRUMP	Why didn't she do something about it?
0	740.0		TRUMP	She talks about taxes.
0	741.0		TRUMP	Why didn't she do something about it?
0	742.0		TRUMP	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.
0	743.0		TRUMP	With her, it's all talk and no action.
0	744.0		COOPER	In the past...
0	745.0		TRUMP	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.
0	746.0		TRUMP	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.
0	747.0		TRUMP	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.
1	748.0		TRUMP	I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.
0	749.0		TRUMP	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.
0	750.0		TRUMP	Congratulations.
0	751.0		TRUMP	Great job.
0	752.0		COOPER	Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.
0	753.0		CLINTON	Well, here we go again.
0	754.0		CLINTON	I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.
0	755.0		CLINTON	But that's not the point here.
0	756.0		TRUMP	Why didn't you do it?
0	757.0		TRUMP	Why didn't you do it?
0	758.0		COOPER	Allow her to respond.
0	759.0		CLINTON	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.
0	760.0		TRUMP	Oh, really?
0	761.0		CLINTON	I will be the president and we will get it done.
0	762.0		CLINTON	That's exactly right.
0	763.0		TRUMP	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.
0	764.0		TRUMP	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.
0	765.0		TRUMP	But you were not an effective senator.
0	766.0		COOPER	Please allow her to respond.
0	767.0		COOPER	She didn't interrupt you.
0	768.0		CLINTON	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.
0	769.0		CLINTON	"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""
0	770.0		CLINTON	So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.
0	771.0		CLINTON	I'm very glad to do so.
0	772.0		CLINTON	Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.
0	773.0		CLINTON	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.
0	774.0		CLINTON	After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.
0	775.0		CLINTON	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.
0	776.0		CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.
0	777.0		CLINTON	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.
0	778.0		CLINTON	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.
0	779.0		CLINTON	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.
0	780.0		COOPER	Thank you, secretary.
0	781.0		CLINTON	I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.
0	782.0		COOPER	Thank you, secretary.
0	783.0		RADDATZ	We're going to move on to Syria.
0	784.0		RADDATZ	Both of you have mentioned that.
0	785.0		TRUMP	She said a lot of things that were false.
0	786.0		TRUMP	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...
0	787.0		RADDATZ	No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.
0	788.0		RADDATZ	This is about the audience.
0	789.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	790.0		TRUMP	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.
0	791.0		TRUMP	A disaster.
0	792.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.
0	793.0		RADDATZ	The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.
0	794.0		RADDATZ	But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.
0	795.0		RADDATZ	Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.
0	796.0		RADDATZ	So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.
0	797.0		RADDATZ	Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
0	798.0		RADDATZ	Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?
0	799.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.
0	800.0		CLINTON	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.
0	801.0		CLINTON	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.
0	802.0		CLINTON	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.
0	803.0		CLINTON	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.
0	804.0		CLINTON	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.
0	805.0		CLINTON	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.
0	806.0		CLINTON	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.
0	807.0		CLINTON	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.
0	808.0		CLINTON	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.
0	809.0		CLINTON	Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.
0	810.0		CLINTON	And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.
0	811.0		CLINTON	I've stood up to Russia.
0	812.0		CLINTON	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.
0	813.0		CLINTON	I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.
0	814.0		CLINTON	And I did as secretary of state.
1	815.0		CLINTON	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.
0	816.0		CLINTON	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.
0	817.0		CLINTON	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.
0	818.0		CLINTON	But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.
0	819.0		RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	820.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?
0	821.0		TRUMP	First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...
0	822.0		CLINTON	No, I wasn't.
0	823.0		CLINTON	I was gone.
0	824.0		CLINTON	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...
0	825.0		TRUMP	OK.
0	826.0		TRUMP	But you were in contact -- excuse me.
0	827.0		TRUMP	You were...
0	828.0		CLINTON	At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.
0	829.0		TRUMP	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.
0	830.0		TRUMP	I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.
0	831.0		TRUMP	Obama draws the line in the sand.
0	832.0		TRUMP	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.
0	833.0		TRUMP	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.
0	834.0		TRUMP	But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.
0	835.0		TRUMP	Not good.
0	836.0		TRUMP	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.
0	837.0		TRUMP	Russia is new in terms of nuclear.
0	838.0		TRUMP	We are old.
0	839.0		TRUMP	We're tired.
0	840.0		TRUMP	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.
0	841.0		TRUMP	A very bad thing.
0	842.0		TRUMP	Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.
0	843.0		TRUMP	She talks in favor of the rebels.
0	844.0		TRUMP	She doesn't even know who the rebels are.
0	845.0		TRUMP	You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.
0	846.0		TRUMP	And you know what happens?
0	847.0		TRUMP	They end up being worse than the people.
0	848.0		TRUMP	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.
0	849.0		TRUMP	Gadhafi's out.
0	850.0		TRUMP	It's a mess.
1	851.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.
0	852.0		TRUMP	I'm sure you probably have heard that.
0	853.0		TRUMP	It was a disaster.
0	854.0		TRUMP	Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
0	855.0		TRUMP	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.
0	856.0		TRUMP	We sign a peace treaty.
0	857.0		TRUMP	Everyone's all excited.
0	858.0		TRUMP	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.
0	859.0		TRUMP	But look at that deal.
0	860.0		TRUMP	Iran now and Russia are now against us.
0	861.0		TRUMP	So she wants to fight.
0	862.0		TRUMP	She wants to fight for rebels.
0	863.0		TRUMP	There's only one problem.
0	864.0		TRUMP	You don't even know who the rebels are.
0	865.0		TRUMP	So what's the purpose?
0	866.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.
0	867.0		TRUMP	And one thing I have to say.
0	868.0		RADDATZ	Your two minutes is up.
0	869.0		TRUMP	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.
0	870.0		TRUMP	Russia is killing ISIS.
0	871.0		TRUMP	And Iran is killing ISIS.
0	872.0		TRUMP	And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
0	873.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.
0	874.0		RADDATZ	If you were president...
0	875.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	876.0		RADDATZ	what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?
0	877.0		RADDATZ	And I want to remind you what your running mate said.
0	878.0		RADDATZ	He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.
0	879.0		TRUMP	OK.
0	880.0		TRUMP	He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.
0	881.0		TRUMP	I disagree.
0	882.0		RADDATZ	You disagree with your running mate?
0	883.0		TRUMP	I think you have to knock out ISIS.
0	884.0		TRUMP	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.
0	885.0		TRUMP	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.
0	886.0		TRUMP	But Syria is no longer Syria.
0	887.0		TRUMP	Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.
0	888.0		TRUMP	I believe we have to get ISIS.
0	889.0		TRUMP	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.
0	890.0		TRUMP	She had a chance to do something with Syria.
0	891.0		TRUMP	They had a chance.
0	892.0		TRUMP	And that was the line.
0	893.0		TRUMP	And she didn't.
0	894.0		RADDATZ	What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
0	895.0		TRUMP	I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.
0	896.0		RADDATZ	What do you think will happen if it falls?
0	897.0		TRUMP	I think that it basically has fallen.
0	898.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	899.0		TRUMP	It basically has fallen.
0	900.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you something.
0	901.0		TRUMP	You take a look at Mosul.
0	902.0		TRUMP	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.
0	903.0		TRUMP	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.
0	904.0		TRUMP	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.
0	905.0		TRUMP	Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.
0	906.0		TRUMP	Why can't they do it quietly?
0	907.0		TRUMP	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?
0	908.0		TRUMP	People leave.
0	909.0		TRUMP	Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?
0	910.0		TRUMP	How stupid is our country?
0	911.0		RADDATZ	There are sometimes reasons the military does that.
0	912.0		RADDATZ	Psychological warfare.
0	913.0		TRUMP	I can't think of any.
0	914.0		TRUMP	I can't think of any.
0	915.0		TRUMP	And I'm pretty good at it.
0	916.0		RADDATZ	It might be to help get civilians out.
0	917.0		TRUMP	And we have General Flynn.
0	918.0		TRUMP	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.
0	919.0		TRUMP	I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.
0	920.0		TRUMP	We talk about it all the time.
0	921.0		TRUMP	They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?
0	922.0		TRUMP	How -- why would these people stay there?
0	923.0		TRUMP	I've been reading now...
0	924.0		RADDATZ	Tell me what your strategy is.
0	925.0		TRUMP	for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.
0	926.0		TRUMP	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.
0	927.0		TRUMP	They're gone.
0	928.0		TRUMP	Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.
0	929.0		TRUMP	Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.
0	930.0		TRUMP	All I say is this.
0	931.0		TRUMP	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.
0	932.0		RADDATZ	I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.
0	933.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.
0	934.0		RADDATZ	You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.
0	935.0		RADDATZ	You talk about diplomatic efforts.
0	936.0		RADDATZ	Those have failed.
0	937.0		RADDATZ	Cease-fires have failed.
0	938.0		RADDATZ	Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?
0	939.0		CLINTON	I would not use American ground forces in Syria.
0	940.0		CLINTON	I think that would be a very serious mistake.
0	941.0		CLINTON	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.
0	942.0		CLINTON	I don't think that is a smart strategy.
0	943.0		CLINTON	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...
0	944.0		RADDATZ	But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?
0	945.0		CLINTON	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...
0	946.0		TRUMP	Everything.
0	947.0		CLINTON	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.
0	948.0		CLINTON	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.
0	949.0		CLINTON	And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.
0	950.0		CLINTON	No, he doesn't.
0	951.0		CLINTON	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.
0	952.0		CLINTON	And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.
0	953.0		CLINTON	I would go after Baghdadi.
0	954.0		CLINTON	I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.
0	955.0		CLINTON	So I think that could help.
0	956.0		CLINTON	I would also consider arming the Kurds.
0	957.0		CLINTON	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.
0	958.0		CLINTON	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.
0	959.0		RADDATZ	Thank you very much.
0	960.0		RADDATZ	We're going to move on...
0	961.0		TRUMP	You know what's funny?
0	962.0		TRUMP	She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.
0	963.0		TRUMP	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.
0	964.0		RADDATZ	You had many answers.
0	965.0		TRUMP	It's really -- it's really very interesting.
0	966.0		COOPER	We've got a question over here from James Carter.
0	967.0		COOPER	Mr. Carter?
0	968.0		QUESTION	My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?
0	969.0		COOPER	That question begins for Mr. Trump.
0	970.0		TRUMP	Absolutely.
0	971.0		TRUMP	I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.
0	972.0		TRUMP	I will be a president for all of our people.
0	973.0		TRUMP	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.
1	974.0		TRUMP	Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.
0	975.0		TRUMP	Not in this country.
1	976.0		TRUMP	It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.
0	977.0		TRUMP	We lost our jobs.
0	978.0		TRUMP	We lost our money.
0	979.0		TRUMP	We lost our plants.
0	980.0		TRUMP	It is a disaster.
0	981.0		TRUMP	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.
0	982.0		TRUMP	She called it the gold standard.
0	983.0		TRUMP	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.
0	984.0		TRUMP	They actually said that she lied.
0	985.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	986.0		TRUMP	And she lied.
0	987.0		TRUMP	But she's lied about a lot of things.
0	988.0		TRUMP	I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.
0	989.0		TRUMP	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.
0	990.0		TRUMP	She's been talking about it for years.
0	991.0		TRUMP	As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.
0	992.0		TRUMP	She doesn't get it done.
0	993.0		TRUMP	Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.
0	994.0		TRUMP	The same exact thing.
0	995.0		TRUMP	They talk, they don't get it done.
0	996.0		TRUMP	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.
0	997.0		TRUMP	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.
0	998.0		TRUMP	The education is a disaster.
0	999.0		TRUMP	Jobs are essentially nonexistent.
0	1000.0		TRUMP	I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?
0	1001.0		TRUMP	It can't get any worse.
0	1002.0		TRUMP	And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.
0	1003.0		TRUMP	Nothing's going to ever happen.
0	1004.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.
0	1005.0		TRUMP	It's just going to be talk.
0	1006.0		TRUMP	And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.
0	1007.0		TRUMP	She's not doing any me favors.
0	1008.0		TRUMP	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.
0	1009.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, thank you.
0	1010.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you, she's all talk.
0	1011.0		TRUMP	It doesn't get done.
0	1012.0		TRUMP	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.
0	1013.0		TRUMP	Take a look at upstate New York.
0	1014.0		COOPER	Your two minutes is up.
0	1015.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, two minutes?
0	1016.0		TRUMP	It turned out to be a disaster.
0	1017.0		COOPER	You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
0	1018.0		CLINTON	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.
0	1019.0		CLINTON	Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.
0	1020.0		CLINTON	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.
0	1021.0		CLINTON	And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.
0	1022.0		CLINTON	I'm proud of that.
0	1023.0		CLINTON	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.
0	1024.0		CLINTON	I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.
0	1025.0		CLINTON	I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.
0	1026.0		CLINTON	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.
0	1027.0		CLINTON	And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.
0	1028.0		CLINTON	They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.
0	1029.0		CLINTON	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.
0	1030.0		CLINTON	He's 10 years old now.
0	1031.0		CLINTON	This is the only one country he's ever known.
0	1032.0		CLINTON	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?
0	1033.0		CLINTON	You know, children listen to what is being said.
0	1034.0		CLINTON	To go back to the very, very first question.
0	1035.0		CLINTON	And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.
0	1036.0		CLINTON	Bullying is up.
0	1037.0		CLINTON	A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.
0	1038.0		CLINTON	A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.
0	1039.0		CLINTON	So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.
0	1040.0		COOPER	Your time, Secretary Clinton.
0	1041.0		CLINTON	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.
0	1042.0		CLINTON	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.
0	1043.0		COOPER	Your two minutes is up.
0	1044.0		CLINTON	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.
0	1045.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up.
0	1046.0		COOPER	I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month.
0	1047.0		COOPER	"You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, ""deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic."""
0	1048.0		COOPER	You later said you regretted saying half.
0	1049.0		COOPER	"You didn't express regret for using the term ""deplorables."""
0	1050.0		COOPER	To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?
0	1051.0		CLINTON	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.
0	1052.0		CLINTON	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.
0	1053.0		CLINTON	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.
0	1054.0		CLINTON	And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.
0	1055.0		CLINTON	We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.
0	1056.0		CLINTON	And he is supporting me 100 percent.
0	1057.0		COOPER	Thank you.
0	1058.0		CLINTON	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.
0	1059.0		CLINTON	We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...
0	1060.0		COOPER	Thank you, Secretary.
0	1061.0		TRUMP	but we believed that we could make the country better.
0	1062.0		TRUMP	And I was proud of that.
0	1063.0		COOPER	I want to give you a minute to respond.
0	1064.0		TRUMP	We have a divided nation.
0	1065.0		TRUMP	We have a very divided nation.
0	1066.0		TRUMP	You look at Charlotte.
0	1067.0		TRUMP	You look at Baltimore.
0	1068.0		TRUMP	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.
0	1069.0		TRUMP	We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.
0	1070.0		TRUMP	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.
0	1071.0		TRUMP	And when she said deplorables, she meant it.
0	1072.0		TRUMP	And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.
0	1073.0		COOPER	She said some of them are irredeemable.
0	1074.0		TRUMP	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.
0	1075.0		TRUMP	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.
0	1076.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you.
0	1077.0		COOPER	In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.
0	1078.0		COOPER	"You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, ""he or she won't be one for very long."""
1	1079.0		COOPER	In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.
0	1080.0		COOPER	Is that the discipline of a good leader?
0	1081.0		TRUMP	No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.
0	1082.0		TRUMP	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
0	1083.0		COOPER	You mentioned sex tape.
0	1084.0		TRUMP	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.
0	1085.0		TRUMP	She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?
0	1086.0		TRUMP	Guess what?
0	1087.0		TRUMP	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...
0	1088.0		COOPER	The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?
0	1089.0		TRUMP	600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.
0	1090.0		TRUMP	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.
0	1091.0		TRUMP	But she said she'll be awake.
0	1092.0		TRUMP	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.
0	1093.0		TRUMP	Guess what happened?
1	1094.0		TRUMP	Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.
0	1095.0		TRUMP	And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.
0	1096.0		TRUMP	So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.
0	1097.0		TRUMP	Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.
0	1098.0		TRUMP	I mean, you can like it or not like it.
0	1099.0		TRUMP	I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.
0	1100.0		TRUMP	It's a very effective way of communication.
0	1101.0		TRUMP	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.
0	1102.0		TRUMP	I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.
0	1103.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?
0	1104.0		CLINTON	No.
0	1105.0		TRUMP	I'm shocked to hear that.
0	1106.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1107.0		CLINTON	Well, it's not only my opinion.
0	1108.0		CLINTON	It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.
0	1109.0		CLINTON	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.
0	1110.0		CLINTON	Everybody.
0	1111.0		CLINTON	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.
0	1112.0		CLINTON	And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.
0	1113.0		CLINTON	He stuck with me.
0	1114.0		CLINTON	And I have worked and I admire President Obama.
0	1115.0		CLINTON	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
0	1116.0		CLINTON	That was a terrible time for our country.
0	1117.0		COOPER	We have to move along.
0	1118.0		CLINTON	Nine million people lost their jobs.
0	1119.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we have to...
0	1120.0		CLINTON	Five million homes were lost.
0	1121.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we're moving.
0	1122.0		CLINTON	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
0	1123.0		CLINTON	We are back on the right track.
0	1124.0		CLINTON	He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.
0	1125.0		RADDATZ	Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question.
0	1126.0		RADDATZ	We're almost out of time.
0	1127.0		RADDATZ	We have another...
0	1128.0		TRUMP	We have the slowest growth since 1929.
0	1129.0		RADDATZ	We're moving to an audience question.
0	1130.0		TRUMP	It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
0	1131.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience.
0	1132.0		RADDATZ	Thank you very much both of you.
0	1133.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1134.0		RADDATZ	We have another audience question.
0	1135.0		RADDATZ	Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.
0	1136.0		QUESTION	Good evening.
0	1137.0		QUESTION	Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.
0	1138.0		QUESTION	What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?
0	1139.0		RADDATZ	We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
0	1140.0		CLINTON	Thank you.
0	1141.0		CLINTON	Well, you're right.
0	1142.0		CLINTON	This is one of the most important issues in this election.
0	1143.0		CLINTON	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.
0	1144.0		CLINTON	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.
0	1145.0		CLINTON	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.
0	1146.0		CLINTON	Donald doesn't agree with that.
0	1147.0		CLINTON	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.
0	1148.0		CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.
0	1149.0		CLINTON	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.
0	1150.0		CLINTON	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.
0	1151.0		CLINTON	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.
0	1152.0		CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.
0	1153.0		CLINTON	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.
0	1154.0		CLINTON	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.
0	1155.0		CLINTON	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.
0	1156.0		CLINTON	I think that was a dereliction of duty.
0	1157.0		CLINTON	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.
0	1158.0		RADDATZ	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	1159.0		RADDATZ	Thank you.
0	1160.0		RADDATZ	You're out of time.
0	1161.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?
0	1162.0		TRUMP	Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.
0	1163.0		TRUMP	And we have a vacancy.
0	1164.0		TRUMP	I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.
0	1165.0		TRUMP	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.
0	1166.0		TRUMP	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.
0	1167.0		TRUMP	And I think that this is so important.
0	1168.0		TRUMP	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.
0	1169.0		TRUMP	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.
0	1170.0		TRUMP	So important to me.
0	1171.0		TRUMP	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.
0	1172.0		TRUMP	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.
0	1173.0		TRUMP	What I ask is this.
0	1174.0		TRUMP	So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.
0	1175.0		TRUMP	Pretty much self-funding money.
0	1176.0		TRUMP	We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.
0	1177.0		TRUMP	I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.
0	1178.0		TRUMP	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.
0	1179.0		TRUMP	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?
0	1180.0		TRUMP	It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.
0	1181.0		TRUMP	Why aren't you putting some money in?
0	1182.0		TRUMP	You have a lot of it.
0	1183.0		TRUMP	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.
0	1184.0		TRUMP	Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.
0	1185.0		TRUMP	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?
0	1186.0		TRUMP	I'm just curious.
0	1187.0		CLINTON	Well...
0	1188.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1189.0		RADDATZ	Thank you very much.
0	1190.0		RADDATZ	We're going to get on to one more question.
0	1191.0		CLINTON	The question was about the Supreme Court.
0	1192.0		CLINTON	And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.
0	1193.0		CLINTON	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.
0	1194.0		COOPER	Thank you.
0	1195.0		RADDATZ	We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.
0	1196.0		CLINTON	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
0	1197.0		COOPER	We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.
0	1198.0		COOPER	Ken?
0	1199.0		QUESTION	What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
0	1200.0		COOPER	Mr. Trump, two minutes?
0	1201.0		TRUMP	Absolutely.
0	1202.0		TRUMP	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.
0	1203.0		TRUMP	Under absolutely siege.
0	1204.0		TRUMP	The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.
0	1205.0		TRUMP	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.
0	1206.0		TRUMP	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.
0	1207.0		TRUMP	Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.
0	1208.0		TRUMP	But we need much more than wind and solar.
0	1209.0		TRUMP	And you look at our miners.
1	1210.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.
0	1211.0		TRUMP	There is a thing called clean coal.
0	1212.0		TRUMP	Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.
0	1213.0		TRUMP	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.
0	1214.0		TRUMP	We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.
0	1215.0		TRUMP	So good.
0	1216.0		TRUMP	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.
0	1217.0		TRUMP	I will bring our energy companies back.
0	1218.0		TRUMP	They'll be able to compete.
0	1219.0		TRUMP	They'll make money.
0	1220.0		TRUMP	They'll pay off our national debt.
0	1221.0		TRUMP	They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.
0	1222.0		TRUMP	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.
0	1223.0		TRUMP	We have to bring back our workers.
0	1224.0		TRUMP	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.
0	1225.0		TRUMP	We have to guard our energy companies.
0	1226.0		TRUMP	We have to make it possible.
0	1227.0		TRUMP	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.
0	1228.0		TRUMP	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.
0	1229.0		TRUMP	It's a disgrace.
0	1230.0		COOPER	Your time is up.
0	1231.0		COOPER	Thank you.
0	1232.0		TRUMP	It's an absolute disgrace.
0	1233.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton, two minutes.
0	1234.0		CLINTON	And actually -- well, that was very interesting.
0	1235.0		CLINTON	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.
0	1236.0		CLINTON	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.
1	1237.0		CLINTON	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.
0	1238.0		CLINTON	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.
0	1239.0		CLINTON	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.
0	1240.0		CLINTON	So the price of oil has been way down.
0	1241.0		CLINTON	And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?
0	1242.0		CLINTON	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.
0	1243.0		CLINTON	And I think that's an important transition.
0	1244.0		CLINTON	We've got to remain energy-independent.
0	1245.0		CLINTON	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.
0	1246.0		CLINTON	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.
0	1247.0		CLINTON	So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.
0	1248.0		CLINTON	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.
0	1249.0		CLINTON	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.
0	1250.0		CLINTON	That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.
0	1251.0		CLINTON	A lot of them lost their lives.
0	1252.0		CLINTON	They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.
0	1253.0		CLINTON	I don't want to walk away from them.
0	1254.0		CLINTON	So we've got to do something for them.
0	1255.0		COOPER	Secretary Clinton...
0	1256.0		CLINTON	But the price of coal is down worldwide.
0	1257.0		CLINTON	So we have to look at this comprehensively.
0	1258.0		COOPER	Your time is up.
0	1259.0		CLINTON	And that's exactly what I have proposed.
0	1260.0		CLINTON	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.
0	1261.0		COOPER	Time is up.
0	1262.0		COOPER	We have time for one more...
0	1263.0		RADDATZ	We have...
0	1264.0		COOPER	One more audience question.
0	1265.0		RADDATZ	We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.
0	1266.0		QUESTION	Good evening.
0	1267.0		QUESTION	My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?
0	1268.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1269.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?
0	1270.0		CLINTON	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.
0	1271.0		CLINTON	Look, I respect his children.
0	1272.0		CLINTON	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.
0	1273.0		CLINTON	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.
0	1274.0		CLINTON	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.
0	1275.0		CLINTON	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.
0	1276.0		CLINTON	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.
0	1277.0		CLINTON	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.
0	1278.0		CLINTON	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
0	1279.0		CLINTON	And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.
0	1280.0		CLINTON	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.
0	1281.0		CLINTON	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.
0	1282.0		RADDATZ	Mr. Trump?
0	1283.0		TRUMP	Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.
0	1284.0		TRUMP	I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.
0	1285.0		TRUMP	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.
0	1286.0		TRUMP	So I consider that a compliment.
0	1287.0		TRUMP	I will say this about Hillary.
0	1288.0		TRUMP	She doesn't quit.
0	1289.0		TRUMP	She doesn't give up.
0	1290.0		TRUMP	I respect that.
0	1291.0		TRUMP	I tell it like it is.
0	1292.0		TRUMP	She's a fighter.
0	1293.0		TRUMP	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.
0	1294.0		TRUMP	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.
0	1295.0		TRUMP	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.
0	1296.0		TRUMP	And I consider that to be a very good trait.
0	1297.0		RADDATZ	Thanks to both of you.
0	1298.0		COOPER	We want to thank both the candidates.
0	1299.0		COOPER	We want to thank the university here.
0	1300.0		COOPER	This concludes the town hall meeting.
0	1301.0		COOPER	Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.
0	1302.0		RADDATZ	Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
0	1303.0		RADDATZ	Good night, everyone.
0	1.0		WALLACE	Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
0	2.0		WALLACE	I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
0	3.0		WALLACE	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
0	4.0		WALLACE	The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.
0	5.0		WALLACE	Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.
0	6.0		WALLACE	For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.
0	7.0		WALLACE	None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.
0	8.0		WALLACE	The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.
0	9.0		WALLACE	No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.
0	10.0		WALLACE	No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.
0	11.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	12.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.
0	13.0		WALLACE	Let's get right to it.
0	14.0		WALLACE	The first topic is the Supreme Court.
0	15.0		WALLACE	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.
0	16.0		WALLACE	Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.
0	17.0		WALLACE	First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?
0	18.0		WALLACE	And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?
0	19.0		WALLACE	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?
0	20.0		WALLACE	In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.
0	21.0		WALLACE	You have two minutes.
0	22.0		CLINTON	Thank you very much, Chris.
0	23.0		CLINTON	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.
0	24.0		CLINTON	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?
0	25.0		CLINTON	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?
0	26.0		CLINTON	What kind of rights will Americans have?
0	27.0		CLINTON	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.
0	28.0		CLINTON	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.
0	29.0		CLINTON	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.
0	30.0		CLINTON	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.
0	31.0		CLINTON	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.
0	32.0		CLINTON	And I look forward to having that opportunity.
0	33.0		CLINTON	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.
0	34.0		CLINTON	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.
0	35.0		CLINTON	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.
0	36.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
0	37.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.
0	38.0		WALLACE	Where do you want to see the court take the country?
0	39.0		WALLACE	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?
0	40.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.
0	41.0		TRUMP	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.
0	42.0		TRUMP	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.
0	43.0		TRUMP	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.
0	44.0		TRUMP	And she was forced to apologize.
0	45.0		TRUMP	And apologize she did.
0	46.0		TRUMP	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.
0	47.0		TRUMP	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.
0	48.0		TRUMP	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.
0	49.0		TRUMP	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.
0	50.0		TRUMP	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.
0	51.0		TRUMP	They will have a conservative bent.
0	52.0		TRUMP	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.
0	53.0		TRUMP	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.
0	54.0		TRUMP	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.
0	55.0		TRUMP	And I believe that's very, very important.
0	56.0		TRUMP	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.
0	57.0		TRUMP	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.
0	58.0		TRUMP	And those are the people that I will appoint.
0	59.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, thank you.
0	60.0		WALLACE	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.
0	61.0		WALLACE	I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.
0	62.0		WALLACE	First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.
0	63.0		WALLACE	"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."""
0	64.0		WALLACE	And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.
0	65.0		WALLACE	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.
0	66.0		WALLACE	What's wrong with that?
0	67.0		CLINTON	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.
0	68.0		CLINTON	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.
0	69.0		CLINTON	I represented upstate New York.
0	70.0		CLINTON	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.
0	71.0		CLINTON	It goes back to the founding of our country.
0	72.0		CLINTON	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.
0	73.0		CLINTON	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.
1	74.0		CLINTON	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.
0	75.0		CLINTON	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.
0	76.0		CLINTON	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.
0	77.0		CLINTON	You mentioned the Heller decision.
1	78.0		CLINTON	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.
0	79.0		CLINTON	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.
0	80.0		CLINTON	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.
0	81.0		WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.
0	82.0		WALLACE	The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.
0	83.0		WALLACE	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?
0	84.0		WALLACE	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.
0	85.0		WALLACE	Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?
0	86.0		TRUMP	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.
0	87.0		TRUMP	I watched.
0	88.0		TRUMP	I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.
0	89.0		TRUMP	And Justice Scalia was so involved.
0	90.0		TRUMP	And it was a well-crafted decision.
0	91.0		TRUMP	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.
0	92.0		TRUMP	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.
0	93.0		WALLACE	Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.
0	94.0		WALLACE	Were you extremely upset?
0	95.0		CLINTON	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.
0	96.0		CLINTON	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.
0	97.0		CLINTON	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.
0	98.0		CLINTON	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.
0	99.0		CLINTON	The gun lobby's on his side.
0	100.0		CLINTON	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.
0	101.0		CLINTON	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.
0	102.0		CLINTON	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.
0	103.0		WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.
0	104.0		WALLACE	You support a national right to carry law.
0	105.0		WALLACE	Why, sir?
0	106.0		TRUMP	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.
1	107.0		TRUMP	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.
1	108.0		TRUMP	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.
0	109.0		TRUMP	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
0	110.0		TRUMP	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.
0	111.0		TRUMP	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.
0	112.0		TRUMP	So I'm very honored by all of that.
0	113.0		TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.
0	114.0		TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.
0	115.0		WALLACE	Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.
0	116.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	117.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.
0	118.0		WALLACE	But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?
0	119.0		TRUMP	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.
0	120.0		WALLACE	But I'm asking you specifically.
0	121.0		WALLACE	Would you like to...
0	122.0		TRUMP	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.
0	123.0		WALLACE	But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.
0	124.0		WALLACE	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?
0	125.0		TRUMP	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.
0	126.0		TRUMP	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.
0	127.0		TRUMP	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.
0	128.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?
0	129.0		CLINTON	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.
0	130.0		CLINTON	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.
0	131.0		CLINTON	It is about what's happening right now in America.
0	132.0		CLINTON	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.
1	133.0		CLINTON	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.
1	134.0		CLINTON	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.
0	135.0		CLINTON	I will defend Planned Parenthood.
0	136.0		CLINTON	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.
0	137.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton…
0	138.0		CLINTON	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.
1	139.0		WALLACE	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.
0	140.0		WALLACE	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.
0	141.0		WALLACE	I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.
0	142.0		WALLACE	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.
0	143.0		WALLACE	You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.
0	144.0		WALLACE	Why?
0	145.0		CLINTON	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.
0	146.0		CLINTON	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.
0	147.0		CLINTON	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.
0	148.0		CLINTON	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.
0	149.0		CLINTON	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.
0	150.0		CLINTON	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.
0	151.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your reaction?
0	152.0		WALLACE	And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.
0	153.0		TRUMP	Well, I think it's terrible.
1	154.0		TRUMP	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.
0	155.0		TRUMP	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.
1	156.0		TRUMP	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.
0	157.0		TRUMP	And that's not acceptable.
0	158.0		CLINTON	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.
0	159.0		CLINTON	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
0	160.0		CLINTON	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.
0	161.0		CLINTON	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.
0	162.0		CLINTON	And I do not believe the government should be making it.
0	163.0		CLINTON	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.
0	164.0		CLINTON	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.
0	165.0		CLINTON	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.
0	166.0		CLINTON	And I will stand up for that right.
0	167.0		WALLACE	All right.
0	168.0		WALLACE	But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...
0	169.0		TRUMP	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.
0	170.0		TRUMP	Nobody has that.
0	171.0		WALLACE	All right.
0	172.0		WALLACE	Let's move on to the subject of immigration.
0	173.0		WALLACE	And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.
0	174.0		WALLACE	Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.
0	175.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.
0	176.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.
0	177.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.
0	178.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.
0	179.0		WALLACE	The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?
0	180.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.
0	181.0		WALLACE	You have two minutes.
0	182.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.
0	183.0		TRUMP	We need strong borders.
0	184.0		TRUMP	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.
0	185.0		TRUMP	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.
0	186.0		TRUMP	They're coming in illegally.
0	187.0		TRUMP	Drugs are pouring in through the border.
0	188.0		TRUMP	We have no country if we have no border.
0	189.0		TRUMP	Hillary wants to give amnesty.
0	190.0		TRUMP	She wants to have open borders.
0	191.0		TRUMP	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.
0	192.0		TRUMP	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.
0	193.0		TRUMP	It means their job is tougher.
0	194.0		TRUMP	But they know what's going on.
0	195.0		TRUMP	They know it better than anybody.
0	196.0		TRUMP	They want strong borders.
0	197.0		TRUMP	They feel we have to have strong borders.
0	198.0		TRUMP	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
0	199.0		TRUMP	The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.
0	200.0		TRUMP	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
0	201.0		TRUMP	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
0	202.0		TRUMP	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.
0	203.0		TRUMP	We have to have strong borders.
0	204.0		TRUMP	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.
0	205.0		TRUMP	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.
0	206.0		TRUMP	We need strong borders.
0	207.0		TRUMP	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.
0	208.0		TRUMP	Now, I want to build the wall.
0	209.0		TRUMP	We need the wall.
0	210.0		TRUMP	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.
0	211.0		TRUMP	We stop the drugs.
0	212.0		TRUMP	We shore up the border.
0	213.0		TRUMP	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.
0	214.0		TRUMP	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.
0	215.0		TRUMP	And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.
0	216.0		TRUMP	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.
0	217.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, thank you.
0	218.0		WALLACE	Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.
0	219.0		WALLACE	Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?
0	220.0		CLINTON	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.
0	221.0		CLINTON	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.
0	222.0		CLINTON	And you're right.
0	223.0		CLINTON	I don't want to rip families apart.
0	224.0		CLINTON	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.
0	225.0		CLINTON	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.
0	226.0		CLINTON	We have 11 million undocumented people.
0	227.0		CLINTON	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.
0	228.0		CLINTON	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.
0	229.0		CLINTON	Now, here's what that means.
0	230.0		CLINTON	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.
0	231.0		CLINTON	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.
0	232.0		CLINTON	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.
0	233.0		CLINTON	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.
0	234.0		CLINTON	I have been for border security for years.
0	235.0		CLINTON	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.
0	236.0		CLINTON	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.
0	237.0		CLINTON	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.
0	238.0		CLINTON	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.
0	239.0		CLINTON	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.
0	240.0		CLINTON	Didn't even raise it.
0	241.0		CLINTON	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.
0	242.0		CLINTON	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.
0	243.0		CLINTON	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.
0	244.0		WALLACE	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0	245.0		WALLACE	I want to follow up...
0	246.0		TRUMP	Chris, I think it's...
0	247.0		WALLACE	OK.
0	248.0		TRUMP	I think I should respond to that.
0	249.0		TRUMP	First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.
0	250.0		TRUMP	Very nice man.
0	251.0		TRUMP	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.
0	252.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
1	253.0		TRUMP	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.
1	254.0		TRUMP	It's a disaster.
0	255.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
0	256.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.
0	257.0		TRUMP	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.
0	258.0		TRUMP	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
0	259.0		WALLACE	Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...
0	260.0		TRUMP	We are a country of laws.
0	261.0		TRUMP	We either have -- and by the way...
0	262.0		WALLACE	Now, wait.
0	263.0		WALLACE	I'd like to hear from...
0	264.0		TRUMP	Well -- well, but she said one thing.
0	265.0		WALLACE	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
0	266.0		CLINTON	I voted for border security, and there are...
0	267.0		TRUMP	And the wall.
0	268.0		CLINTON	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.
0	269.0		CLINTON	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
0	270.0		CLINTON	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.
0	271.0		CLINTON	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.
0	272.0		CLINTON	And Donald knows a lot about this.
1	273.0		CLINTON	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.
1	274.0		CLINTON	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""
0	275.0		CLINTON	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.
0	276.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump?
0	277.0		TRUMP	President Obama has moved millions of people out.
0	278.0		TRUMP	Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.
0	279.0		TRUMP	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.
0	280.0		TRUMP	They've been deported.
0	281.0		TRUMP	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.
0	282.0		TRUMP	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.
0	283.0		TRUMP	We're a country of laws.
0	284.0		TRUMP	We either have a border or we don't.
0	285.0		TRUMP	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.
0	286.0		TRUMP	But it's very unfair.
0	287.0		TRUMP	We have millions of people that did it the right way.
0	288.0		TRUMP	They're on line.
0	289.0		TRUMP	They're waiting.
0	290.0		TRUMP	We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.
0	291.0		TRUMP	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.
1	292.0		TRUMP	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.
0	293.0		TRUMP	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.
0	294.0		WALLACE	I want to...
1	295.0		TRUMP	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
0	296.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to...
0	297.0		CLINTON	We will not have open borders.
0	298.0		CLINTON	That is...
0	299.0		WALLACE	Well, let me -- Secretary...
0	300.0		CLINTON	That is a rank mischaracterization.
0	301.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton...
0	302.0		CLINTON	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.
0	303.0		CLINTON	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.
0	304.0		CLINTON	Ronald Reagan was the last president...
0	305.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, excuse me.
0	306.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton.
0	307.0		CLINTON	to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.
0	308.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.
1	309.0		WALLACE	My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.
0	310.0		WALLACE	So that's the question...
0	311.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	312.0		WALLACE	That's the question.
0	313.0		WALLACE	Please quiet, everybody.
0	314.0		WALLACE	Is that your dream, open borders?
0	315.0		CLINTON	Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.
1	316.0		CLINTON	You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.
0	317.0		CLINTON	And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.
0	318.0		CLINTON	I think that would be a great benefit to us.
0	319.0		CLINTON	But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.
0	320.0		CLINTON	And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
0	321.0		CLINTON	They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.
0	322.0		CLINTON	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
0	323.0		CLINTON	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.
0	324.0		CLINTON	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?
0	325.0		CLINTON	Those are the questions we need answered.
0	326.0		CLINTON	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.
0	327.0		WALLACE	Well?
0	328.0		TRUMP	That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?
0	329.0		TRUMP	How did we get on to Putin?
0	330.0		WALLACE	Hold on -- hold on, wait.
0	331.0		WALLACE	Hold on, folks.
0	332.0		WALLACE	Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.
0	333.0		WALLACE	Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.
0	334.0		TRUMP	So just to finish on the borders...
0	335.0		WALLACE	Yes?
0	336.0		TRUMP	She wants open borders.
0	337.0		TRUMP	People are going to pour into our country.
0	338.0		TRUMP	People are going to come in from Syria.
0	339.0		TRUMP	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.
0	340.0		TRUMP	They have no idea where they come from.
0	341.0		TRUMP	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.
0	342.0		TRUMP	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.
0	343.0		TRUMP	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.
0	344.0		TRUMP	Now we can talk about Putin.
0	345.0		TRUMP	I don't know Putin.
0	346.0		TRUMP	He said nice things about me.
0	347.0		TRUMP	If we got along well, that would be good.
0	348.0		TRUMP	If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.
0	349.0		TRUMP	He has no respect for her.
0	350.0		TRUMP	He has no respect for our president.
0	351.0		TRUMP	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.
0	352.0		TRUMP	And she's playing chicken.
0	353.0		TRUMP	Look, Putin...
0	354.0		WALLACE	Wait, but...
0	355.0		TRUMP	from everything I see, has no respect for this person.
0	356.0		CLINTON	Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.
0	357.0		TRUMP	No puppet.
0	358.0		TRUMP	No puppet.
0	359.0		CLINTON	And it's pretty clear...
0	360.0		TRUMP	You're the puppet!
0	361.0		CLINTON	It's pretty clear you won't admit...
0	362.0		TRUMP	No, you're the puppet.
1	363.0		CLINTON	that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.
0	364.0		CLINTON	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.
0	365.0		CLINTON	We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.
1	366.0		CLINTON	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.
0	367.0		CLINTON	I find that deeply disturbing.
0	368.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton...
0	369.0		CLINTON	And I think it's time you take a stand...
1	370.0		TRUMP	She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.
0	371.0		CLINTON	I am not quoting myself.
0	372.0		TRUMP	She has no idea.
0	373.0		CLINTON	I am quoting 17...
0	374.0		TRUMP	Hillary, you have no idea.
0	375.0		CLINTON	17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
0	376.0		TRUMP	And our country has no idea.
0	377.0		CLINTON	agencies.
0	378.0		TRUMP	Yeah, I doubt it.
0	379.0		TRUMP	I doubt it.
0	380.0		CLINTON	Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.
0	381.0		CLINTON	I find that just absolutely...
0	382.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	383.0		TRUMP	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
0	384.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump...
0	385.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	386.0		TRUMP	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.
0	387.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump...
0	388.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	389.0		TRUMP	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.
0	390.0		WALLACE	I do get to ask some questions.
0	391.0		TRUMP	Yes, that's fine.
0	392.0		WALLACE	And I would like to ask you this direct question.
0	393.0		WALLACE	The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.
0	394.0		WALLACE	Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?
0	395.0		TRUMP	By Russia or anybody else.
0	396.0		WALLACE	You condemn their interference?
0	397.0		TRUMP	Of course I condemn.
0	398.0		TRUMP	Of course I -- I don't know Putin.
0	399.0		TRUMP	I have no idea.
0	400.0		WALLACE	I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?
0	401.0		TRUMP	I never met Putin.
0	402.0		TRUMP	This is not my best friend.
0	403.0		TRUMP	But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.
0	404.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.
0	405.0		TRUMP	Whether it's Syria, you name it.
0	406.0		TRUMP	Missiles.
0	407.0		TRUMP	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."
0	408.0		TRUMP	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.
0	409.0		TRUMP	They create warheads, and we can't.
0	410.0		TRUMP	The Russians can't believe it.
0	411.0		TRUMP	She has been outsmarted by Putin.
0	412.0		TRUMP	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.
0	413.0		TRUMP	They've taken over.
0	414.0		TRUMP	We've spent $6 trillion.
0	415.0		TRUMP	They've taken over the Middle East.
0	416.0		TRUMP	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.
0	417.0		WALLACE	We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic.
0	418.0		WALLACE	You got about 45 seconds.
0	419.0		TRUMP	And she always will be.
0	420.0		CLINTON	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.
0	421.0		CLINTON	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.
0	422.0		CLINTON	He's...
0	423.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
1	424.0		CLINTON	advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
1	425.0		CLINTON	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.
0	426.0		CLINTON	But here's the deal.
0	427.0		CLINTON	The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
0	428.0		CLINTON	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
0	429.0		CLINTON	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.
0	430.0		TRUMP	I have 200 generals...
0	431.0		WALLACE	Very quickly.
0	432.0		TRUMP	and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.
0	433.0		TRUMP	As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.
0	434.0		TRUMP	We are spending a fortune doing it.
0	435.0		TRUMP	They have the bargain of the century.
1	436.0		TRUMP	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.
0	437.0		TRUMP	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.
0	438.0		WALLACE	OK.
0	439.0		TRUMP	Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.
0	440.0		TRUMP	This is just another lie.
0	441.0		CLINTON	Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...
1	442.0		TRUMP	There's no quote.
1	443.0		TRUMP	You're not going to find a quote from me.
1	444.0		CLINTON	about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.
0	445.0		CLINTON	That kind...
0	446.0		TRUMP	And defend yourselves.
0	447.0		CLINTON	of language -- well...
0	448.0		TRUMP	And defend yourselves.
0	449.0		TRUMP	I didn't say nuclear.
0	450.0		TRUMP	And defend yourself.
0	451.0		CLINTON	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.
0	452.0		CLINTON	Donald wants to tear up our alliances.
0	453.0		CLINTON	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.
0	454.0		CLINTON	I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.
0	455.0		CLINTON	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.
0	456.0		WALLACE	We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.
0	457.0		WALLACE	And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.
0	458.0		WALLACE	You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.
0	459.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.
0	460.0		WALLACE	You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.
0	461.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.
0	462.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	463.0		WALLACE	We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.
0	464.0		WALLACE	But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.
0	465.0		WALLACE	In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.
0	466.0		CLINTON	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.
0	467.0		CLINTON	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.
0	468.0		CLINTON	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.
0	469.0		CLINTON	I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.
0	470.0		CLINTON	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.
0	471.0		CLINTON	I want us to do more to help small business.
0	472.0		CLINTON	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.
0	473.0		CLINTON	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.
0	474.0		CLINTON	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.
0	475.0		CLINTON	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.
0	476.0		CLINTON	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.
0	477.0		CLINTON	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.
0	478.0		CLINTON	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.
0	479.0		CLINTON	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.
0	480.0		CLINTON	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.
0	481.0		CLINTON	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.
1	482.0		CLINTON	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.
1	483.0		CLINTON	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.
0	484.0		CLINTON	Why?
0	485.0		CLINTON	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.
0	486.0		CLINTON	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.
0	487.0		CLINTON	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.
0	488.0		WALLACE	Secretary, thank you.
0	489.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?
0	490.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.
0	491.0		TRUMP	Her tax plan is a disaster.
0	492.0		TRUMP	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.
0	493.0		TRUMP	And I'm a big proponent.
0	494.0		TRUMP	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.
0	495.0		TRUMP	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.
1	496.0		TRUMP	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.
0	497.0		TRUMP	But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.
0	498.0		TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.
0	499.0		TRUMP	We protect Saudi Arabia.
0	500.0		TRUMP	Why aren't they paying?
0	501.0		TRUMP	She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.
0	502.0		TRUMP	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?
0	503.0		TRUMP	Because they weren't paying.
0	504.0		TRUMP	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.
0	505.0		TRUMP	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.
0	506.0		TRUMP	All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.
0	507.0		TRUMP	They have to pay up.
0	508.0		TRUMP	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.
0	509.0		TRUMP	And I'm a big fan of NATO.
0	510.0		TRUMP	But they have to pay up.
0	511.0		TRUMP	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.
0	512.0		TRUMP	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.
0	513.0		TRUMP	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.
1	514.0		TRUMP	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.
1	515.0		TRUMP	We're up to $20 trillion.
0	516.0		TRUMP	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.
0	517.0		TRUMP	We're going to have a lot of free trade.
0	518.0		TRUMP	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.
0	519.0		TRUMP	But we have horrible deals.
1	520.0		TRUMP	Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.
1	521.0		TRUMP	Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.
0	522.0		TRUMP	You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.
0	523.0		TRUMP	You go upstate New York.
1	524.0		TRUMP	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.
0	525.0		TRUMP	We're bringing our jobs back.
0	526.0		TRUMP	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
0	527.0		TRUMP	And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.
0	528.0		TRUMP	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.
0	529.0		TRUMP	And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.
0	530.0		TRUMP	We are going to cut taxes massively.
0	531.0		TRUMP	We're going to cut business taxes massively.
0	532.0		TRUMP	They're going to start hiring people.
0	533.0		TRUMP	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...
0	534.0		WALLACE	Time, Mr. Trump.
0	535.0		TRUMP	that's offshore back into the country.
0	536.0		TRUMP	We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...
0	537.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump?
0	538.0		TRUMP	right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.
0	539.0		CLINTON	Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...
0	540.0		TRUMP	You can't.
0	541.0		CLINTON	the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.
0	542.0		CLINTON	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.
1	543.0		CLINTON	I also will not add a penny to the debt.
0	544.0		CLINTON	I have costed out what I'm going to do.
1	545.0		CLINTON	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.
0	546.0		CLINTON	Well, he mentioned the debt.
0	547.0		CLINTON	We know how to get control of the debt.
0	548.0		CLINTON	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.
0	549.0		CLINTON	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.
0	550.0		CLINTON	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.
0	551.0		CLINTON	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.
0	552.0		CLINTON	So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.
0	553.0		CLINTON	That's the kind of approach that will work.
0	554.0		WALLACE	Secretary...
0	555.0		CLINTON	Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.
0	556.0		CLINTON	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.
0	557.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.
0	558.0		TRUMP	Correct.
0	559.0		WALLACE	Thank you, sir.
0	560.0		WALLACE	You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.
0	561.0		WALLACE	So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?
0	562.0		CLINTON	Well, it's a combination, Chris.
0	563.0		CLINTON	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.
0	564.0		CLINTON	I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.
0	565.0		CLINTON	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.
0	566.0		CLINTON	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
0	567.0		CLINTON	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
0	568.0		CLINTON	But it was a terrible recession.
0	569.0		CLINTON	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.
0	570.0		CLINTON	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.
0	571.0		CLINTON	That is not going to work.
0	572.0		CLINTON	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.
0	573.0		CLINTON	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.
0	574.0		CLINTON	We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.
0	575.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...
0	576.0		TRUMP	Over a 10-year period.
0	577.0		WALLACE	growth is unrealistic.
0	578.0		WALLACE	And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.
0	579.0		WALLACE	They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well.
0	580.0		WALLACE	Your response, sir?
0	581.0		TRUMP	So I just left some high representatives of India.
0	582.0		TRUMP	They're growing at 8 percent.
0	583.0		TRUMP	China is growing at 7 percent.
0	584.0		TRUMP	And that for them is a catastrophically low number.
0	585.0		TRUMP	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.
0	586.0		TRUMP	And I think it's going down.
0	587.0		TRUMP	Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.
0	588.0		TRUMP	A terrible jobs report.
0	589.0		TRUMP	In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?
0	590.0		TRUMP	Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.
0	591.0		TRUMP	The report was so bad.
0	592.0		TRUMP	Look, our country is stagnant.
0	593.0		TRUMP	We've lost our jobs.
0	594.0		TRUMP	We've lost our businesses.
0	595.0		TRUMP	We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.
0	596.0		TRUMP	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.
0	597.0		TRUMP	I've visited so many communities.
0	598.0		TRUMP	This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.
0	599.0		TRUMP	I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.
0	600.0		TRUMP	And they cry when they see what's happened.
0	601.0		TRUMP	I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.
0	602.0		TRUMP	Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.
0	603.0		TRUMP	Boy, did they suffer.
0	604.0		TRUMP	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.
0	605.0		TRUMP	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.
0	606.0		TRUMP	And she wants it.
1	607.0		TRUMP	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.
1	608.0		TRUMP	She totally lied.
1	609.0		TRUMP	She did call it the gold standard.
0	610.0		TRUMP	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.
0	611.0		TRUMP	I was so honored.
0	612.0		WALLACE	I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...
0	613.0		TRUMP	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.
0	614.0		WALLACE	which is Obamacare.
0	615.0		WALLACE	But go ahead, briefly.
1	616.0		CLINTON	Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.
0	617.0		CLINTON	It didn't meet my test.
0	618.0		CLINTON	I've had the same test.
0	619.0		CLINTON	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?
0	620.0		CLINTON	I'm against it now.
0	621.0		CLINTON	I'll be against it after the election.
0	622.0		CLINTON	I'll be against it when I'm president.
0	623.0		CLINTON	There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.
0	624.0		CLINTON	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.
0	625.0		CLINTON	But he mentioned China.
0	626.0		CLINTON	And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.
0	627.0		CLINTON	I have fought against that as a senator.
0	628.0		CLINTON	I've stood up against it as secretary of state.
0	629.0		CLINTON	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.
0	630.0		CLINTON	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.
0	631.0		CLINTON	So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.
0	632.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump?
0	633.0		CLINTON	That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
0	634.0		TRUMP	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.
0	635.0		CLINTON	We're going to pull the country together.
0	636.0		CLINTON	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.
0	637.0		CLINTON	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.
0	638.0		CLINTON	And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.
0	639.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?
0	640.0		WALLACE	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
0	641.0		TRUMP	Let me ask a simple question.
0	642.0		TRUMP	She's been doing this for 30 years.
0	643.0		TRUMP	Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?
0	644.0		CLINTON	No, I voted.
0	645.0		TRUMP	You were very much involved -- excuse me.
0	646.0		TRUMP	My turn.
0	647.0		TRUMP	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.
0	648.0		TRUMP	Very much.
0	649.0		TRUMP	And you do have experience.
0	650.0		TRUMP	I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.
0	651.0		TRUMP	For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.
0	652.0		TRUMP	I wouldn't mind.
0	653.0		TRUMP	The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.
0	654.0		TRUMP	You don't.
1	655.0		TRUMP	Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.
1	656.0		TRUMP	How do you miss $6 billion?
1	657.0		TRUMP	You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.
0	658.0		TRUMP	They don't know.
1	659.0		TRUMP	It's gone, $6 billion.
0	660.0		TRUMP	If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.
0	661.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	662.0		CLINTON	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.
0	663.0		CLINTON	But I think it's really an important issue.
0	664.0		CLINTON	He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.
0	665.0		CLINTON	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.
0	666.0		CLINTON	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.
0	667.0		CLINTON	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.
0	668.0		CLINTON	In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.
1	669.0		CLINTON	He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.
0	670.0		CLINTON	In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.
0	671.0		CLINTON	He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.
0	672.0		TRUMP	Give me a break.
0	673.0		CLINTON	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""
0	674.0		CLINTON	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.
0	675.0		TRUMP	Well, I think I did a much better job.
0	676.0		TRUMP	I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.
1	677.0		TRUMP	I started with a $1 million loan.
0	678.0		TRUMP	I agree with that.
1	679.0		TRUMP	It's a $1 million loan.
0	680.0		TRUMP	But I built a phenomenal company.
0	681.0		TRUMP	And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.
0	682.0		TRUMP	You would even be proud of it.
0	683.0		TRUMP	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.
0	684.0		TRUMP	Take a look at the migration.
0	685.0		TRUMP	Take a look at Libya.
0	686.0		TRUMP	Take a look at Iraq.
1	687.0		TRUMP	She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.
1	688.0		TRUMP	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.
0	689.0		TRUMP	And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.
0	690.0		TRUMP	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.
0	691.0		TRUMP	She's going to get rid of nobody.
0	692.0		WALLACE	All right.
0	693.0		WALLACE	We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States.
0	694.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it.
0	695.0		WALLACE	And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.
0	696.0		WALLACE	Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?
0	697.0		WALLACE	Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse.
0	698.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you go first.
1	699.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.
0	700.0		TRUMP	Those people -- I don't know those people.
0	701.0		TRUMP	I have a feeling how they came.
0	702.0		TRUMP	I believe it was her campaign that did it.
0	703.0		TRUMP	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?
0	704.0		TRUMP	She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.
0	705.0		TRUMP	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.
1	706.0		TRUMP	I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.
0	707.0		TRUMP	And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.
1	708.0		TRUMP	I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.
0	709.0		TRUMP	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.
0	710.0		TRUMP	And I think it's her campaign.
0	711.0		TRUMP	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.
0	712.0		TRUMP	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.
0	713.0		TRUMP	And that was now all on tape, started by her.
0	714.0		TRUMP	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.
0	715.0		TRUMP	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.
0	716.0		TRUMP	But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.
0	717.0		TRUMP	It was lies, and it was fiction.
0	718.0		CLINTON	Well...
0	719.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?
0	720.0		CLINTON	At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.
0	721.0		CLINTON	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.
0	722.0		CLINTON	Now, what was his response?
1	723.0		CLINTON	Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.
0	724.0		TRUMP	I did not say that.
0	725.0		TRUMP	I did not say that.
0	726.0		CLINTON	In fact, he went on to say...
0	727.0		WALLACE	Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.
0	728.0		WALLACE	Her two minutes.
0	729.0		TRUMP	I did not say that.
0	730.0		WALLACE	It's her two minutes.
1	731.0		CLINTON	"He went on to say, ""Look at her."
1	732.0		CLINTON	"I don't think so."""
1	733.0		CLINTON	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""
0	734.0		CLINTON	"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."
0	735.0		CLINTON	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.
0	736.0		CLINTON	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.
0	737.0		CLINTON	So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.
0	738.0		CLINTON	That's who Donald is.
0	739.0		CLINTON	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.
0	740.0		CLINTON	America is great, because America is good.
0	741.0		CLINTON	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.
0	742.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump...
0	743.0		TRUMP	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
0	744.0		TRUMP	Nobody.
0	745.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	746.0		TRUMP	Nobody has more respect...
0	747.0		WALLACE	Please, everybody.
1	748.0		TRUMP	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.
0	749.0		TRUMP	And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.
0	750.0		TRUMP	She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.
1	751.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
0	752.0		TRUMP	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.
0	753.0		TRUMP	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.
0	754.0		TRUMP	One lie.
0	755.0		TRUMP	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.
0	756.0		TRUMP	He's going to probably go to jail.
0	757.0		TRUMP	This is a four-star general.
0	758.0		TRUMP	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?
0	759.0		TRUMP	That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.
0	760.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?
0	761.0		CLINTON	Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.
0	762.0		CLINTON	And it's not just about women.
0	763.0		CLINTON	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.
0	764.0		CLINTON	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.
0	765.0		CLINTON	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.
0	766.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	767.0		CLINTON	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.
0	768.0		CLINTON	"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""
0	769.0		CLINTON	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.
0	770.0		CLINTON	So it's not one thing.
0	771.0		CLINTON	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.
0	772.0		CLINTON	That is not who America is.
0	773.0		CLINTON	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.
0	774.0		CLINTON	It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.
0	775.0		TRUMP	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.
0	776.0		TRUMP	It's on tape.
0	777.0		WALLACE	During the last...
0	778.0		TRUMP	The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...
0	779.0		WALLACE	OK.
0	780.0		TRUMP	but those other charges, as she knows, are false.
0	781.0		WALLACE	In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate.
0	782.0		WALLACE	I'd like to ask you about them.
0	783.0		WALLACE	These are questions that the American people have.
0	784.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you.
0	785.0		WALLACE	Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.
0	786.0		WALLACE	Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?
0	787.0		WALLACE	And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?
0	788.0		CLINTON	Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.
0	789.0		CLINTON	The State Department has said that.
0	790.0		CLINTON	I think that's been proven.
0	791.0		CLINTON	But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.
0	792.0		CLINTON	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.
0	793.0		CLINTON	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.
0	794.0		CLINTON	In partnership with the American Health Association...
0	795.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton...
0	796.0		CLINTON	we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...
0	797.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.
0	798.0		CLINTON	Well, it is an open discussion.
0	799.0		CLINTON	And you...
0	800.0		WALLACE	And the specific question went to pay for play.
0	801.0		WALLACE	Do you want to talk about that?
0	802.0		CLINTON	Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...
0	803.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	804.0		TRUMP	I think that it's been very well...
0	805.0		WALLACE	Let's ask Mr. Trump.
0	806.0		CLINTON	There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...
0	807.0		TRUMP	It's been very well studied.
0	808.0		CLINTON	and the high rankings...
0	809.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	810.0		WALLACE	Please let me Mr. Trump speak.
0	811.0		TRUMP	and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.
0	812.0		WALLACE	Please let Mr. Trump speak.
0	813.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	814.0		TRUMP	It's a criminal enterprise.
0	815.0		TRUMP	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.
0	816.0		TRUMP	You talk about women and women's rights?
0	817.0		TRUMP	So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.
0	818.0		TRUMP	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.
0	819.0		TRUMP	And yet you take their money.
0	820.0		TRUMP	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?
0	821.0		TRUMP	Why don't you give back the money?
0	822.0		TRUMP	I think it would be a great gesture.
0	823.0		TRUMP	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.
0	824.0		TRUMP	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.
0	825.0		TRUMP	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.
0	826.0		TRUMP	And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.
0	827.0		TRUMP	And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.
0	828.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?
1	829.0		CLINTON	Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.
0	830.0		CLINTON	I'm very proud of that.
1	831.0		CLINTON	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.
0	832.0		CLINTON	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.
0	833.0		CLINTON	I mean, who does that?
0	834.0		CLINTON	It just was astonishing.
0	835.0		CLINTON	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.
0	836.0		CLINTON	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.
0	837.0		CLINTON	Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.
0	838.0		CLINTON	The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.
0	839.0		CLINTON	We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.
0	840.0		CLINTON	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...
0	841.0		WALLACE	All right.
0	842.0		CLINTON	because it's an important part of the American experience.
0	843.0		TRUMP	They don't want you to help them anymore.
0	844.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	845.0		TRUMP	I'd like to mention one thing.
0	846.0		TRUMP	Trump Foundation, small foundation.
0	847.0		TRUMP	People contribute, I contribute.
1	848.0		TRUMP	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.
1	849.0		TRUMP	I don't get anything.
1	850.0		TRUMP	I don't buy boats.
1	851.0		TRUMP	I don't buy planes.
1	852.0		TRUMP	What happens -- the money goes to them.
1	853.0		WALLACE	Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?
1	854.0		TRUMP	No, it was -- we put up the American flag.
0	855.0		TRUMP	And that's it.
0	856.0		TRUMP	They put up the American flag.
0	857.0		TRUMP	We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.
0	858.0		WALLACE	Right.
1	859.0		WALLACE	But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...
0	860.0		TRUMP	There was.
0	861.0		TRUMP	There was.
0	862.0		TRUMP	And, by the way...
0	863.0		WALLACE	instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.
0	864.0		TRUMP	the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.
0	865.0		WALLACE	I want to get into one...
0	866.0		CLINTON	But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.
0	867.0		CLINTON	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.
0	868.0		CLINTON	You can look at our tax returns.
0	869.0		CLINTON	We've got them all out there.
1	870.0		CLINTON	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.
0	871.0		CLINTON	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.
0	872.0		CLINTON	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.
0	873.0		CLINTON	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.
0	874.0		CLINTON	I find that just astonishing.
0	875.0		WALLACE	I want...
1	876.0		TRUMP	So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.
1	877.0		TRUMP	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...
0	878.0		WALLACE	We...
0	879.0		TRUMP	Let me just explain.
0	880.0		WALLACE	But, no, we heard this...
0	881.0		TRUMP	Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.
0	882.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, we -- OK.
0	883.0		TRUMP	You know what she should have done?
0	884.0		WALLACE	Folks, we heard this...
0	885.0		TRUMP	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...
0	886.0		WALLACE	Folks, we heard this...
0	887.0		TRUMP	because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.
0	888.0		CLINTON	Well, you know...
0	889.0		TRUMP	You should have changed the law.
0	890.0		TRUMP	But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.
0	891.0		TRUMP	I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...
0	892.0		CLINTON	Made with Chinese steel.
0	893.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you, I sat there...
0	894.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	895.0		TRUMP	I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.
0	896.0		TRUMP	All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.
0	897.0		TRUMP	And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.
0	898.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump...
0	899.0		TRUMP	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.
0	900.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.
0	901.0		WALLACE	You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.
0	902.0		WALLACE	"Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election."""
0	903.0		WALLACE	Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing.
0	904.0		WALLACE	I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?
0	905.0		TRUMP	I will look at it at the time.
0	906.0		TRUMP	I'm not looking at anything now.
0	907.0		TRUMP	I'll look at it at the time.
0	908.0		TRUMP	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.
0	909.0		TRUMP	First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.
0	910.0		TRUMP	The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.
0	911.0		TRUMP	It's so dishonest.
0	912.0		TRUMP	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.
0	913.0		TRUMP	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.
0	914.0		TRUMP	I think they're going to see through it.
0	915.0		TRUMP	We'll find out on November 8th.
0	916.0		TRUMP	But I think they're going to see through it.
0	917.0		WALLACE	But, sir, there's...
1	918.0		TRUMP	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.
0	919.0		TRUMP	So let me just give you one other thing.
0	920.0		TRUMP	So I talk about the corrupt media.
0	921.0		TRUMP	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.
0	922.0		TRUMP	She shouldn't be allowed to run.
0	923.0		TRUMP	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.
0	924.0		TRUMP	She should not be allowed to run.
0	925.0		TRUMP	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...
0	926.0		WALLACE	But...
0	927.0		TRUMP	Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.
0	928.0		WALLACE	But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.
0	929.0		WALLACE	Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.
0	930.0		WALLACE	Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?
0	931.0		TRUMP	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.
0	932.0		TRUMP	I'll keep you in suspense.
0	933.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	934.0		CLINTON	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.
0	935.0		CLINTON	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.
0	936.0		CLINTON	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.
0	937.0		CLINTON	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.
0	938.0		CLINTON	He lost the Iowa caucus.
0	939.0		CLINTON	He lost the Wisconsin primary.
0	940.0		CLINTON	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.
0	941.0		CLINTON	Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.
0	942.0		CLINTON	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
0	943.0		TRUMP	Should have gotten it.
0	944.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	945.0		CLINTON	This is -- this is a mindset.
0	946.0		CLINTON	This is how Donald thinks.
0	947.0		CLINTON	And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.
0	948.0		WALLACE	OK.
0	949.0		CLINTON	So that is not the way our democracy works.
0	950.0		CLINTON	We've been around for 240 years.
0	951.0		CLINTON	We've had free and fair elections.
0	952.0		CLINTON	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.
0	953.0		CLINTON	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.
0	954.0		CLINTON	You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...
0	955.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	956.0		WALLACE	Hold on.
0	957.0		WALLACE	Hold on, folks.
0	958.0		WALLACE	Hold on, folks.
0	959.0		CLINTON	it just shows you're not up to doing the job.
0	960.0		CLINTON	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.
0	961.0		CLINTON	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.
0	962.0		CLINTON	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.
0	963.0		TRUMP	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.
0	964.0		TRUMP	I think it's a disgrace.
0	965.0		WALLACE	All right.
0	966.0		TRUMP	I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.
0	967.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	968.0		WALLACE	Hold on, folks.
0	969.0		WALLACE	This doesn't do any good for anyone.
0	970.0		WALLACE	Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.
0	971.0		WALLACE	The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.
0	972.0		WALLACE	If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?
0	973.0		WALLACE	And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.
0	974.0		WALLACE	Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?
0	975.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.
0	976.0		WALLACE	You have two minutes.
0	977.0		CLINTON	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.
0	978.0		CLINTON	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.
0	979.0		CLINTON	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.
0	980.0		CLINTON	In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.
0	981.0		CLINTON	The goal here is to take back Mosul.
0	982.0		CLINTON	It's going to be a hard fight.
0	983.0		CLINTON	I've got no illusions about that.
0	984.0		CLINTON	And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.
0	985.0		CLINTON	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.
0	986.0		CLINTON	But we know we've got lots of work to do.
0	987.0		CLINTON	Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.
0	988.0		CLINTON	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.
0	989.0		CLINTON	That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.
0	990.0		CLINTON	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.
0	991.0		CLINTON	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.
0	992.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.
0	993.0		WALLACE	If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?
0	994.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.
0	995.0		TRUMP	We had Mosul.
0	996.0		TRUMP	But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.
0	997.0		TRUMP	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.
0	998.0		TRUMP	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.
0	999.0		TRUMP	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.
0	1000.0		TRUMP	Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?
0	1001.0		TRUMP	We announce we're going after Mosul.
0	1002.0		TRUMP	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?
0	1003.0		TRUMP	These people have all left.
0	1004.0		TRUMP	They've all left.
0	1005.0		TRUMP	The element of surprise.
0	1006.0		TRUMP	Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.
0	1007.0		TRUMP	So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.
0	1008.0		TRUMP	All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.
0	1009.0		TRUMP	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?
0	1010.0		TRUMP	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.
0	1011.0		TRUMP	They want to look good.
0	1012.0		TRUMP	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.
0	1013.0		TRUMP	That's why we have the great migration.
0	1014.0		TRUMP	But she wanted to look good for the election.
0	1015.0		TRUMP	So they're going in.
0	1016.0		TRUMP	But who's going to get Mosul, really?
0	1017.0		TRUMP	We'll take Mosul eventually.
0	1018.0		TRUMP	But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.
0	1019.0		TRUMP	Much, much tougher.
0	1020.0		TRUMP	Much more dangerous.
0	1021.0		TRUMP	Going to be more deaths that they thought.
0	1022.0		TRUMP	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.
0	1023.0		TRUMP	They say, what do we need this for?
0	1024.0		TRUMP	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.
0	1025.0		TRUMP	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.
0	1026.0		TRUMP	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.
0	1027.0		TRUMP	So we're now going to take Mosul.
0	1028.0		TRUMP	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?
0	1029.0		TRUMP	Iran.
0	1030.0		TRUMP	Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.
0	1031.0		TRUMP	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.
0	1032.0		TRUMP	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.
0	1033.0		TRUMP	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.
0	1034.0		WALLACE	Sir, your two minutes are up.
0	1035.0		TRUMP	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.
0	1036.0		CLINTON	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.
0	1037.0		CLINTON	I said it was a mistake.
0	1038.0		CLINTON	I've said that years ago.
0	1039.0		CLINTON	He has consistently denied what is...
0	1040.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	1041.0		CLINTON	a very clear fact that...
0	1042.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
1	1043.0		CLINTON	before the invasion, he supported it.
0	1044.0		CLINTON	And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.
0	1045.0		CLINTON	"Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."""
1	1046.0		CLINTON	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.
0	1047.0		TRUMP	Wrong.
0	1048.0		CLINTON	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.
0	1049.0		CLINTON	Now, why does that matter?
0	1050.0		CLINTON	Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.
0	1051.0		CLINTON	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
0	1052.0		CLINTON	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.
0	1053.0		CLINTON	Mosul is a Sunni city.
0	1054.0		CLINTON	Mosul is on the border of Syria.
0	1055.0		CLINTON	"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."
0	1056.0		CLINTON	We need to go after the leadership.
0	1057.0		CLINTON	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.
0	1058.0		CLINTON	There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.
0	1059.0		CLINTON	They've been digging underground.
0	1060.0		CLINTON	They've been prepared to defend.
0	1061.0		CLINTON	It's going to be tough fighting.
0	1062.0		CLINTON	But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.
0	1063.0		CLINTON	This is what we have to do.
0	1064.0		CLINTON	I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.
0	1065.0		CLINTON	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.
0	1066.0		TRUMP	Chris, we don't gain anything.
0	1067.0		CLINTON	He has all the conspiracy theories...
0	1068.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1069.0		TRUMP	Iran is taking over Iraq.
0	1070.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, it's...
0	1071.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1072.0		TRUMP	Iran is taking over Iraq.
0	1073.0		TRUMP	We don't gain anything.
0	1074.0		CLINTON	This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.
0	1075.0		TRUMP	If they did it by surprise...
0	1076.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1077.0		WALLACE	Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.
0	1078.0		CLINTON	He says...
0	1079.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	1080.0		TRUMP	We could have gained if they did it by surprise.
0	1081.0		WALLACE	Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.
0	1082.0		CLINTON	unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.
0	1083.0		TRUMP	No, you are the one that's unfit.
0	1084.0		TRUMP	You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.
0	1085.0		TRUMP	He said some beauties.
0	1086.0		TRUMP	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.
0	1087.0		TRUMP	You do.
0	1088.0		TRUMP	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.
0	1089.0		TRUMP	If you think that was good, then you do.
0	1090.0		TRUMP	Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.
0	1091.0		TRUMP	Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.
0	1092.0		TRUMP	I agree with both.
0	1093.0		CLINTON	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.
0	1094.0		CLINTON	And he has said...
0	1095.0		TRUMP	Which is a big mistake.
0	1096.0		CLINTON	as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.
0	1097.0		CLINTON	I think he's right.
0	1098.0		WALLACE	Let's turn to Aleppo.
0	1099.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
0	1100.0		WALLACE	And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir.
0	1101.0		WALLACE	You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.
0	1102.0		WALLACE	In fact, there -- in fact, there are...
0	1103.0		TRUMP	It's a catastrophe.
0	1104.0		TRUMP	I mean...
0	1105.0		WALLACE	It's a catastrophe, but there...
0	1106.0		TRUMP	it's a mess.
0	1107.0		WALLACE	There are a quarter of...
0	1108.0		TRUMP	Have you seen it?
0	1109.0		TRUMP	Have you seen it?
0	1110.0		WALLACE	Sir...
0	1111.0		TRUMP	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?
0	1112.0		WALLACE	Sir, if I may finish my question...
0	1113.0		TRUMP	OK, so it hasn't fallen.
0	1114.0		TRUMP	Take a look at it.
0	1115.0		WALLACE	Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.
0	1116.0		TRUMP	That's right.
0	1117.0		TRUMP	And they are being slaughtered...
0	1118.0		WALLACE	Yes.
0	1119.0		TRUMP	because of bad decisions.
0	1120.0		WALLACE	If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS.
0	1121.0		WALLACE	In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.
0	1122.0		WALLACE	Would you like to clear that up, sir?
0	1123.0		TRUMP	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.
0	1124.0		TRUMP	It's a humanitarian nightmare.
0	1125.0		TRUMP	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.
0	1126.0		TRUMP	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?
0	1127.0		TRUMP	Take a look at Aleppo.
0	1128.0		TRUMP	It is so sad when you see what's happened.
0	1129.0		TRUMP	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.
0	1130.0		TRUMP	And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.
0	1131.0		TRUMP	He -- he aligned with Russia.
0	1132.0		TRUMP	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.
0	1133.0		TRUMP	We gave them $150 billion back.
0	1134.0		TRUMP	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.
0	1135.0		TRUMP	I mean, cash.
0	1136.0		TRUMP	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.
0	1137.0		TRUMP	We gave them $1.7 billion.
0	1138.0		TRUMP	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.
0	1139.0		TRUMP	They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.
0	1140.0		TRUMP	We don't know who the rebels are.
0	1141.0		TRUMP	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.
0	1142.0		TRUMP	We don't know who the rebels are.
0	1143.0		TRUMP	And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.
0	1144.0		TRUMP	But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.
0	1145.0		TRUMP	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.
0	1146.0		TRUMP	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...
0	1147.0		WALLACE	Let me...
0	1148.0		TRUMP	in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.
0	1149.0		TRUMP	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.
0	1150.0		TRUMP	Lots of luck, Hillary.
0	1151.0		TRUMP	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.
0	1152.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.
0	1153.0		WALLACE	President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.
0	1154.0		WALLACE	And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia.
0	1155.0		WALLACE	So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?
0	1156.0		WALLACE	Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?
0	1157.0		CLINTON	Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.
0	1158.0		CLINTON	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.
0	1159.0		CLINTON	This would not be done just on the first day.
0	1160.0		CLINTON	This would take a lot of negotiation.
0	1161.0		CLINTON	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.
0	1162.0		CLINTON	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.
0	1163.0		CLINTON	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.
0	1164.0		CLINTON	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.
0	1165.0		CLINTON	He's made these claims repeatedly.
0	1166.0		CLINTON	I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.
0	1167.0		CLINTON	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.
0	1168.0		CLINTON	That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.
0	1169.0		CLINTON	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.
0	1170.0		CLINTON	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.
0	1171.0		CLINTON	In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.
0	1172.0		CLINTON	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.
0	1173.0		CLINTON	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.
0	1174.0		WALLACE	Folks, I want to get into our final segment.
0	1175.0		TRUMP	But I just have to...
0	1176.0		WALLACE	Real quick.
0	1177.0		TRUMP	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.
0	1178.0		TRUMP	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.
0	1179.0		TRUMP	And right now, they're in 32 countries.
0	1180.0		WALLACE	OK.
0	1181.0		TRUMP	We should have -- wait one second.
0	1182.0		TRUMP	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.
0	1183.0		TRUMP	A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.
0	1184.0		TRUMP	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.
0	1185.0		TRUMP	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.
0	1186.0		TRUMP	They are outplayed.
0	1187.0		TRUMP	Now, she wasn't there.
0	1188.0		TRUMP	I assume she had nothing to do with it.
0	1189.0		TRUMP	But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.
0	1190.0		TRUMP	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.
0	1191.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.
0	1192.0		WALLACE	Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.
0	1193.0		WALLACE	That's the highest since just after World War II.
0	1194.0		WALLACE	But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.
0	1195.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.
0	1196.0		WALLACE	The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?
0	1197.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you go first.
0	1198.0		TRUMP	Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.
0	1199.0		TRUMP	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.
0	1200.0		TRUMP	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.
0	1201.0		TRUMP	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.
0	1202.0		TRUMP	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.
0	1203.0		TRUMP	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.
0	1204.0		TRUMP	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.
0	1205.0		TRUMP	To do that, we're taking back jobs.
0	1206.0		TRUMP	We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.
0	1207.0		TRUMP	It's very sad.
0	1208.0		TRUMP	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.
0	1209.0		TRUMP	We used to be there.
0	1210.0		TRUMP	We've given it up.
0	1211.0		TRUMP	We've become very, very sloppy.
0	1212.0		TRUMP	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.
0	1213.0		TRUMP	You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.
0	1214.0		TRUMP	But we don't use those people.
0	1215.0		TRUMP	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.
0	1216.0		TRUMP	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.
0	1217.0		TRUMP	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.
0	1218.0		TRUMP	We use political hacks.
0	1219.0		TRUMP	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.
0	1220.0		TRUMP	So we have to use our great people.
0	1221.0		TRUMP	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.
0	1222.0		TRUMP	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.
0	1223.0		TRUMP	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.
0	1224.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?
0	1225.0		CLINTON	"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."
0	1226.0		CLINTON	"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."
0	1227.0		CLINTON	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.
0	1228.0		CLINTON	He was criticizing President Reagan.
0	1229.0		CLINTON	"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."
0	1230.0		CLINTON	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.
0	1231.0		CLINTON	I do not add a penny to the national debt.
0	1232.0		CLINTON	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.
0	1233.0		CLINTON	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.
0	1234.0		CLINTON	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.
0	1235.0		CLINTON	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.
0	1236.0		CLINTON	In fact, I think just the opposite.
0	1237.0		CLINTON	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.
0	1238.0		CLINTON	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.
0	1239.0		CLINTON	That's where growth will come from.
0	1240.0		CLINTON	That's why I want to invest in you.
0	1241.0		CLINTON	I want to invest in your family.
0	1242.0		CLINTON	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.
0	1243.0		CLINTON	And we just have a big disagreement about this.
0	1244.0		CLINTON	It may be because of our experiences.
0	1245.0		CLINTON	You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...
0	1246.0		TRUMP	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.
0	1247.0		CLINTON	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.
0	1248.0		TRUMP	We've heard this before.
0	1249.0		CLINTON	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.
0	1250.0		WALLACE	Time.
0	1251.0		TRUMP	Thank you, Hillary.
0	1252.0		TRUMP	Could I just respond?
0	1253.0		WALLACE	Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...
0	1254.0		TRUMP	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.
0	1255.0		TRUMP	I disagreed with him.
0	1256.0		TRUMP	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.
0	1257.0		TRUMP	I've been waiting for years.
0	1258.0		TRUMP	Nobody does it right.
0	1259.0		WALLACE	OK.
0	1260.0		TRUMP	And frankly, now we're going to do it right.
0	1261.0		WALLACE	All right.
0	1262.0		WALLACE	The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.
0	1263.0		WALLACE	Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.
0	1264.0		WALLACE	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?
0	1265.0		TRUMP	I'm cutting taxes.
0	1266.0		TRUMP	We're going to grow the economy.
0	1267.0		TRUMP	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.
0	1268.0		WALLACE	That's not going to help in the entitlements.
0	1269.0		TRUMP	No, it's going to totally help you.
0	1270.0		TRUMP	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
0	1271.0		TRUMP	It's destroying our country.
0	1272.0		TRUMP	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.
0	1273.0		TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
0	1274.0		TRUMP	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.
0	1275.0		TRUMP	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.
0	1276.0		TRUMP	But Obamacare has to go.
1	1277.0		TRUMP	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.
1	1278.0		TRUMP	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.
0	1279.0		TRUMP	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.
0	1280.0		TRUMP	Bad health care at the most expensive price.
0	1281.0		TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
0	1282.0		WALLACE	And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.
0	1283.0		WALLACE	Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?
0	1284.0		CLINTON	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0	1285.0		CLINTON	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.
0	1286.0		CLINTON	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.
0	1287.0		CLINTON	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...
0	1288.0		TRUMP	Such a nasty woman.
0	1289.0		CLINTON	by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.
0	1290.0		CLINTON	I will not cut benefits.
0	1291.0		CLINTON	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.
0	1292.0		CLINTON	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.
0	1293.0		CLINTON	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.
0	1294.0		CLINTON	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.
0	1295.0		CLINTON	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.
0	1296.0		CLINTON	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.
0	1297.0		CLINTON	What we need to do is go after...
0	1298.0		TRUMP	Your husband disagrees with you.
0	1299.0		CLINTON	the long-term health care drivers.
0	1300.0		CLINTON	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.
0	1301.0		CLINTON	I have a plan for doing that.
0	1302.0		CLINTON	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.
0	1303.0		WALLACE	This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign.
0	1304.0		WALLACE	I would like to end it on a positive note.
0	1305.0		WALLACE	You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.
0	1306.0		WALLACE	So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president.
0	1307.0		WALLACE	This is another new mini-segment.
0	1308.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.
0	1309.0		CLINTON	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.
0	1310.0		CLINTON	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.
0	1311.0		CLINTON	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.
0	1312.0		CLINTON	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.
0	1313.0		CLINTON	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.
0	1314.0		CLINTON	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.
0	1315.0		CLINTON	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.
0	1316.0		CLINTON	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.
0	1317.0		CLINTON	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.
0	1318.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
0	1319.0		WALLACE	Mr. Trump?
0	1320.0		TRUMP	She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.
0	1321.0		TRUMP	Doesn't work that way.
0	1322.0		TRUMP	But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.
0	1323.0		TRUMP	"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""
0	1324.0		TRUMP	We're going to make America great.
0	1325.0		TRUMP	We have a depleted military.
0	1326.0		TRUMP	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.
0	1327.0		TRUMP	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.
0	1328.0		TRUMP	We don't take care of our veterans.
1	1329.0		TRUMP	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.
0	1330.0		TRUMP	That can't happen.
0	1331.0		TRUMP	Our policemen and women are disrespected.
0	1332.0		TRUMP	We need law and order, but we need justice, too.
0	1333.0		TRUMP	Our inner cities are a disaster.
0	1334.0		TRUMP	You get shot walking to the store.
0	1335.0		TRUMP	They have no education.
0	1336.0		TRUMP	They have no jobs.
0	1337.0		TRUMP	I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.
0	1338.0		TRUMP	All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.
0	1339.0		TRUMP	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.
0	1340.0		TRUMP	We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.
0	1341.0		WALLACE	Thank you both.
0	1342.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1343.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks.
0	1344.0		WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.
0	1345.0		WALLACE	That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
0	1346.0		WALLACE	We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us.
0	1347.0		WALLACE	Now the decision is up to you.
0	1348.0		WALLACE	While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away.
0	1349.0		WALLACE	One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote.
0	1350.0		WALLACE	It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.
0	1351.0		WALLACE	Thank you, and good night.
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	2.0		TRUMP	I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr.
0	3.0		TRUMP	Alex Acosta.
0	4.0		TRUMP	He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.
0	5.0		TRUMP	Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.
0	6.0		TRUMP	And he has had a tremendous career.
0	7.0		TRUMP	He’s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed — did very, very well.
0	8.0		TRUMP	And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best.
0	9.0		TRUMP	We just spoke.
0	10.0		TRUMP	And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.
0	11.0		TRUMP	And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that.
0	12.0		TRUMP	Weeks, weeks late.
0	13.0		TRUMP	Office of Management and Budget.
0	14.0		TRUMP	And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.
0	15.0		TRUMP	Paul Singer has just left.
0	16.0		TRUMP	"As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support."
0	17.0		TRUMP	And it’s all about unification.
0	18.0		TRUMP	We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country.
0	19.0		TRUMP	It’s very important to me.
0	20.0		TRUMP	I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me.
0	21.0		TRUMP	So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.
0	22.0		TRUMP	He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally.
0	23.0		TRUMP	And I appreciate that.
0	24.0		TRUMP	I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions.
0	25.0		TRUMP	And I had this time — we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.
0	26.0		TRUMP	Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.
0	27.0		TRUMP	And we’ve done some really good work.
0	28.0		TRUMP	We’re very proud of that.
0	29.0		TRUMP	And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we’ll do some questions — unless you have no questions.
0	30.0		TRUMP	That’s always a possibility.
0	31.0		TRUMP	I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.
0	32.0		TRUMP	We have made incredible progress.
0	33.0		TRUMP	I don’t think there’s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we’ve done.
0	34.0		TRUMP	A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it.
0	35.0		TRUMP	They actually get it, but they don’t write it — let’s put it that way.
0	36.0		TRUMP	But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.
0	37.0		TRUMP	The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.
0	38.0		TRUMP	And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to.
0	39.0		TRUMP	It used to mean, oh, that’s good.
0	40.0		TRUMP	Now it means that’s good for jobs.
0	41.0		TRUMP	Very different.
0	42.0		TRUMP	Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them.
0	43.0		TRUMP	I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.
0	44.0		TRUMP	And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible.
0	45.0		TRUMP	Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay too.
0	46.0		TRUMP	Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.
0	47.0		TRUMP	The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice.
0	48.0		TRUMP	We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control.
0	49.0		TRUMP	The level of dishonesty is out of control.
0	50.0		TRUMP	I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.
0	51.0		TRUMP	I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.
0	52.0		TRUMP	I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure, we’re talking about its entrenchment.
0	53.0		TRUMP	As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic.
0	54.0		TRUMP	But much of it is not — the distortion.
0	55.0		TRUMP	And we’ll talk about it, and you’ll be able to ask me questions about it.
0	56.0		TRUMP	But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people.
0	57.0		TRUMP	As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.
0	58.0		TRUMP	To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad.
0	59.0		TRUMP	A mess.
1	60.0		TRUMP	Jobs are pouring out of the country.
0	61.0		TRUMP	You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places — low-pay, low-wages.
0	62.0		TRUMP	Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.
0	63.0		TRUMP	The Middle East, a disaster.
0	64.0		TRUMP	North Korea — we’ll take care of it, folks.
0	65.0		TRUMP	We’re going to take care of it all.
0	66.0		TRUMP	I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.
0	67.0		TRUMP	Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.
0	68.0		TRUMP	On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.
0	69.0		TRUMP	We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom — and meetings — Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.
0	70.0		TRUMP	Really, really productive conversations.
0	71.0		TRUMP	I would say far more productive than you would understand.
0	72.0		TRUMP	We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.
0	73.0		TRUMP	It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.
0	74.0		TRUMP	I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis — he’s over there now, working very hard — to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.
0	75.0		TRUMP	It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.
0	76.0		TRUMP	They’ve spread like cancer.
0	77.0		TRUMP	ISIS has spread like cancer.
0	78.0		TRUMP	Another mess I inherited.
0	79.0		TRUMP	And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.
0	80.0		TRUMP	And they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.
0	81.0		TRUMP	And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.
0	82.0		TRUMP	And it’s not properly solved now.
0	83.0		TRUMP	It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.
0	84.0		TRUMP	I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.
0	85.0		TRUMP	I’ve had great support from the Senate.
0	86.0		TRUMP	I’ve had great support from Congress generally.
0	87.0		TRUMP	We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.
0	88.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it.
0	89.0		TRUMP	But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild.
0	90.0		TRUMP	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment.
0	91.0		TRUMP	And their equipment is old.
0	92.0		TRUMP	I used it, I talked about it at every stop.
0	93.0		TRUMP	Depleted — it’s depleted.
0	94.0		TRUMP	It won’t be depleted for long.
0	95.0		TRUMP	And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.
0	96.0		TRUMP	We have to have strong law enforcement also.
0	97.0		TRUMP	So we do not go abroad in the search of war.
0	98.0		TRUMP	We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.
0	99.0		TRUMP	At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.
0	100.0		TRUMP	In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people.
0	101.0		TRUMP	These are campaign promises.
0	102.0		TRUMP	Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.
0	103.0		TRUMP	Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders.
0	104.0		TRUMP	"They’re so surprised — ""oh, you’re having strong borders."""
0	105.0		TRUMP	One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.
0	106.0		TRUMP	Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.
0	107.0		TRUMP	They lie to the American people in order to get elected.
0	108.0		TRUMP	Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons.
0	109.0		TRUMP	And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.
0	110.0		TRUMP	I’m here following through on what I pledged to do.
0	111.0		TRUMP	That’s all I’m doing.
0	112.0		TRUMP	I put it out before the American people.
1	113.0		TRUMP	Got 306 Electoral College votes.
0	114.0		TRUMP	I wasn’t supposed to get 222.
0	115.0		TRUMP	They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.
0	116.0		TRUMP	Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.
0	117.0		TRUMP	We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before.
0	118.0		TRUMP	So that’s the way it goes.
1	119.0		TRUMP	I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.
0	120.0		TRUMP	In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason.
0	121.0		TRUMP	But a lot of people are happy about it.
0	122.0		TRUMP	In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.
0	123.0		TRUMP	I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.
0	124.0		TRUMP	Chaos!
0	125.0		TRUMP	Yet, it is the exact opposite.
0	126.0		TRUMP	This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people.
0	127.0		TRUMP	Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved.
0	128.0		TRUMP	How do you not approve him?
0	129.0		TRUMP	He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval.
0	130.0		TRUMP	So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.
0	131.0		TRUMP	So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.
0	132.0		TRUMP	Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.
0	133.0		TRUMP	I just got here.
0	134.0		TRUMP	I got here with no Cabinet.
0	135.0		TRUMP	Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.
0	136.0		TRUMP	So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.
0	137.0		TRUMP	We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.
0	138.0		TRUMP	We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals — bilateral.
0	139.0		TRUMP	We’re going to have one-on-one deals.
0	140.0		TRUMP	We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.
0	141.0		TRUMP	People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.
0	142.0		TRUMP	They go in for a permit — it’s many, many years.
0	143.0		TRUMP	And then at the end of the process — they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense — and at the end of the process, they get rejected.
0	144.0		TRUMP	Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection.
0	145.0		TRUMP	It’s not going to take years.
0	146.0		TRUMP	But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance.
0	147.0		TRUMP	We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.
0	148.0		TRUMP	We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.
0	149.0		TRUMP	We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.
0	150.0		TRUMP	We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.
0	151.0		TRUMP	We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.
0	152.0		TRUMP	Makes sense.
0	153.0		TRUMP	Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.
0	154.0		TRUMP	If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they’re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.
0	155.0		TRUMP	And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.
0	156.0		TRUMP	It’s very important to me.
0	157.0		TRUMP	But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.
0	158.0		TRUMP	We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.
0	159.0		TRUMP	We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities.
0	160.0		TRUMP	Horrible.
0	161.0		TRUMP	We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.
0	162.0		TRUMP	We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.
0	163.0		TRUMP	Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.
0	164.0		TRUMP	We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.
0	165.0		TRUMP	Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process.
0	166.0		TRUMP	And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me.
0	167.0		TRUMP	The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government.
0	168.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to have a wall that works.
0	169.0		TRUMP	We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.
0	170.0		TRUMP	We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.
0	171.0		TRUMP	No more release, no matter who you are — release.
0	172.0		TRUMP	We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.
0	173.0		TRUMP	We are saving American lives every single day.
0	174.0		TRUMP	The court system has not made it easy for us.
0	175.0		TRUMP	And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.
0	176.0		TRUMP	We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.
0	177.0		TRUMP	Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters safe — and is vigorously defending this lawful order.
0	178.0		TRUMP	I will not back down from defending our country.
0	179.0		TRUMP	I got elected on defense of our country.
0	180.0		TRUMP	And I keep my campaign promises.
0	181.0		TRUMP	And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.
0	182.0		TRUMP	They already are.
0	183.0		TRUMP	I can tell you that.
0	184.0		TRUMP	Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.
1	185.0		TRUMP	In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.
0	186.0		TRUMP	I’ve heard 80 percent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 percent of the time.
0	187.0		TRUMP	I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.
0	188.0		TRUMP	But we are appealing that and we are going further.
0	189.0		TRUMP	We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.
0	190.0		TRUMP	At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.
0	191.0		TRUMP	"We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new ""Buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines."
0	192.0		TRUMP	In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.
0	193.0		TRUMP	We want them to use American steel.
0	194.0		TRUMP	And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.
0	195.0		TRUMP	Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that.
0	196.0		TRUMP	And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel?
0	197.0		TRUMP	And they said, that’s a good idea.
0	198.0		TRUMP	We put it in.
0	199.0		TRUMP	To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.
0	200.0		TRUMP	I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
0	201.0		TRUMP	We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.
0	202.0		TRUMP	Obamacare is a disaster, folks.
0	203.0		TRUMP	It’s a disaster.
0	204.0		TRUMP	You can say, oh, Obamacare — I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.
0	205.0		TRUMP	So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.
0	206.0		TRUMP	We’re bringing our jobs back to this country big league.
0	207.0		TRUMP	It’s already happening, but big league.
0	208.0		TRUMP	I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.
0	209.0		TRUMP	You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years.
0	210.0		TRUMP	That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.
0	211.0		TRUMP	You look at Rex Tillerson — he’s out there negotiating right now.
0	212.0		TRUMP	General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.
0	213.0		TRUMP	We have great, great people.
0	214.0		TRUMP	Mick is with us now.
0	215.0		TRUMP	We have great people.
0	216.0		TRUMP	Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.
0	217.0		TRUMP	Now, look, fair trade — not free — fair.
0	218.0		TRUMP	If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore.
0	219.0		TRUMP	Every country takes advantage of us, almost.
0	220.0		TRUMP	I may be able to find a couple that don’t.
0	221.0		TRUMP	But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.
0	222.0		TRUMP	Jobs have already started to surge.
1	223.0		TRUMP	Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.
1	224.0		TRUMP	Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.
0	225.0		TRUMP	They were with me a week ago.
0	226.0		TRUMP	You know — you were here.
0	227.0		TRUMP	General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.
0	228.0		TRUMP	And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left.
0	229.0		TRUMP	And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.
1	230.0		TRUMP	Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.
1	231.0		TRUMP	And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.
1	232.0		TRUMP	Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.
0	233.0		TRUMP	There will be many, many more.
0	234.0		TRUMP	Many more.
0	235.0		TRUMP	These are a few that we’re naming.
0	236.0		TRUMP	Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades and decades and decades, folks.
0	237.0		TRUMP	And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.
0	238.0		TRUMP	Not going to let it happen.
0	239.0		TRUMP	And one more thing.
0	240.0		TRUMP	I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.
0	241.0		TRUMP	But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.
0	242.0		TRUMP	This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.
0	243.0		TRUMP	Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.
0	244.0		TRUMP	And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.
0	245.0		TRUMP	Some very big things are going to be announced next week.
0	246.0		TRUMP	So we’re just getting started.
0	247.0		TRUMP	We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.
0	248.0		TRUMP	I hope to see you there.
0	249.0		TRUMP	And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.
0	250.0		TRUMP	Mara.
0	251.0		TRUMP	Mara, go ahead.
0	252.0		TRUMP	You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.
0	253.0		QUESTION	Did you fire Mike Flynn?
0	254.0		TRUMP	Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.
0	255.0		TRUMP	He respectfully gave it.
0	256.0		TRUMP	He is a man who — there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.
0	257.0		TRUMP	And I was not happy with the way that information was given.
0	258.0		TRUMP	He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.
0	259.0		TRUMP	What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.
0	260.0		TRUMP	That’s the real problem.
0	261.0		TRUMP	And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.
0	262.0		TRUMP	In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — they know nothing about it.
0	263.0		TRUMP	They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.
0	264.0		TRUMP	It’s all fake news.
0	265.0		TRUMP	It’s all fake news.
0	266.0		TRUMP	The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara — and I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information.
0	267.0		TRUMP	And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.
0	268.0		TRUMP	I’ll give you an example.
0	269.0		TRUMP	I called, as you know, Mexico.
0	270.0		TRUMP	It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.
0	271.0		TRUMP	And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.
0	272.0		TRUMP	All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.
0	273.0		TRUMP	It’s supposed to be secret.
0	274.0		TRUMP	It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.
0	275.0		TRUMP	Same thing with Australia.
0	276.0		TRUMP	All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.
0	277.0		TRUMP	The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.
0	278.0		TRUMP	Everybody saw this, and I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?
0	279.0		TRUMP	How do they do it?
0	280.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	281.0		TRUMP	Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.
0	282.0		TRUMP	But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.
0	283.0		TRUMP	Really ashamed.
0	284.0		TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
0	285.0		QUESTION	Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?
0	286.0		TRUMP	Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong.
0	287.0		TRUMP	If anything, he did something right.
0	288.0		TRUMP	He was coming into office, he looked at the information.
0	289.0		TRUMP	He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do.
0	290.0		TRUMP	They’re supposed to be — and he didn’t just call Russia.
0	291.0		TRUMP	He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries.
0	292.0		TRUMP	He’s doing the job.
0	293.0		TRUMP	You know, he was just doing his job.
0	294.0		TRUMP	The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember.
0	295.0		TRUMP	So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me.
0	296.0		TRUMP	And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.
0	297.0		TRUMP	But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember.
0	298.0		TRUMP	And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.
0	299.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	300.0		QUESTION	President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here.
0	301.0		QUESTION	During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?
0	302.0		QUESTION	And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?
0	303.0		TRUMP	Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.
0	304.0		TRUMP	And it was very much discredited, as you know.
0	305.0		TRUMP	It was — it’s a joke.
0	306.0		TRUMP	And the people mentioned in the story — I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.
0	307.0		TRUMP	They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part — I hadn’t spoken to them.
0	308.0		TRUMP	I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him.
0	309.0		TRUMP	I don’t think I’ve ever met him.
0	310.0		TRUMP	And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.
0	311.0		TRUMP	I don’t think I ever met him.
0	312.0		TRUMP	Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.
0	313.0		TRUMP	I didn’t talk to him, ever.
0	314.0		TRUMP	And he thought it was a joke.
0	315.0		TRUMP	The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.
0	316.0		TRUMP	Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.
0	317.0		TRUMP	And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia — but knew that he represented various countries.
0	318.0		TRUMP	That’s what he does.
0	319.0		TRUMP	I mean, people know that.
0	320.0		TRUMP	That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s, by the way — who’s, by the way, a respected man.
0	321.0		TRUMP	He’s a respected man.
0	322.0		TRUMP	But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.
0	323.0		TRUMP	But everybody — people knew that.
0	324.0		TRUMP	Everybody knew that.
0	325.0		TRUMP	So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.
0	326.0		TRUMP	And he said that very forcefully.
0	327.0		TRUMP	I saw his statement.
0	328.0		TRUMP	He said it very forcefully.
0	329.0		TRUMP	Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.
0	330.0		TRUMP	So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.
0	331.0		TRUMP	And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.
0	332.0		TRUMP	I have no loans in Russia.
0	333.0		TRUMP	I don’t have any deals in Russia.
0	334.0		TRUMP	President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.
0	335.0		TRUMP	He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.
0	336.0		TRUMP	But so did many other leaders — almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.
0	337.0		TRUMP	So that’s the extent.
0	338.0		TRUMP	Russia is fake news.
0	339.0		TRUMP	Russia — this is fake news put out by the media.
0	340.0		TRUMP	The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there — because we have our new people going in place right now.
0	341.0		TRUMP	As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.
0	342.0		TRUMP	James Comey at FBI.
0	343.0		TRUMP	Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.
0	344.0		TRUMP	I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.
0	345.0		TRUMP	And he’s still waiting to be approved.
0	346.0		TRUMP	But our new people are going in.
0	347.0		TRUMP	And just while you’re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday.
0	348.0		TRUMP	And it talked about — you saw it, front page.
0	349.0		TRUMP	"So, Director of National Intelligence just put out — acting — a statement: ""Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"" — this was just given to us — ""is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."""
0	350.0		TRUMP	So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal — top — and they just wrote the story is not true.
0	351.0		TRUMP	And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest — because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.
0	352.0		TRUMP	I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.
0	353.0		TRUMP	But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.
0	354.0		TRUMP	How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?
0	355.0		TRUMP	Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?
0	356.0		TRUMP	That was like that story they wrote about the women and me — front page.
0	357.0		TRUMP	Big massive story.
0	358.0		TRUMP	And it was nasty.
0	359.0		TRUMP	And then they called.
0	360.0		TRUMP	"They said, ""We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."""
0	361.0		TRUMP	They called up my office — we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.
0	362.0		TRUMP	And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you — totally misrepresented.
0	363.0		TRUMP	I said, give us a retraction.
0	364.0		TRUMP	They never gave us a retraction.
0	365.0		TRUMP	And, frankly, I then went on to other things.
0	366.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	367.0		QUESTION	Mr. President —
0	368.0		TRUMP	You okay?
0	369.0		QUESTION	I am.
0	370.0		QUESTION	Just wanted to get untangled.
0	371.0		QUESTION	Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.
0	372.0		QUESTION	In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.
0	373.0		TRUMP	Well, I’m talking about Republican.
0	374.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	375.0		QUESTION	President Obama, 332.
0	376.0		QUESTION	George H.W.
0	377.0		QUESTION	Bush, 426 when he won as President.
0	378.0		QUESTION	So why should Americans trust —
0	379.0		TRUMP	Well, no, I was told — I was given that information.
0	380.0		TRUMP	I don’t know.
0	381.0		TRUMP	I was just given.
0	382.0		TRUMP	We had a very, very big margin.
0	383.0		QUESTION	I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you’re providing information that’s fake?
0	384.0		TRUMP	Well, I don’t know.
0	385.0		TRUMP	I was given that information.
0	386.0		TRUMP	I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around.
0	387.0		TRUMP	But it was a very substantial victory.
0	388.0		TRUMP	Do you agree with that?
0	389.0		QUESTION	You’re the President.
0	390.0		TRUMP	Okay, thank you.
0	391.0		TRUMP	That’s a good answer.
0	392.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	393.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, thank you so much.
0	394.0		QUESTION	Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn — there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?
0	395.0		QUESTION	Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?
0	396.0		QUESTION	What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?
0	397.0		QUESTION	And further than that, sir, you’ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.
0	398.0		TRUMP	We are.
0	399.0		QUESTION	Can we ask what you’re doing to do?
0	400.0		QUESTION	And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.
0	401.0		QUESTION	What can you tell us about that?
0	402.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position.
0	403.0		TRUMP	So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.
0	404.0		TRUMP	The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.
0	405.0		TRUMP	And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of.
0	406.0		TRUMP	But I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.
0	407.0		TRUMP	As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong.
0	408.0		TRUMP	My counsel came — Don McGahn, White House Counsel — and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.
0	409.0		TRUMP	He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong.
0	410.0		TRUMP	He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong.
0	411.0		TRUMP	I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.
0	412.0		TRUMP	I said, well, I don’t see — to me, he was doing the job.
0	413.0		TRUMP	The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there.
0	414.0		TRUMP	But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.
0	415.0		TRUMP	As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.
0	416.0		TRUMP	That was very normal.
0	417.0		TRUMP	At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.
0	418.0		TRUMP	After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.
0	419.0		TRUMP	So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man.
0	420.0		TRUMP	Yes, Jon.
0	421.0		QUESTION	On the leaks, sir —
0	422.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon.
0	423.0		QUESTION	Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?
0	424.0		QUESTION	You have said twice today —
0	425.0		TRUMP	Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously.
0	426.0		TRUMP	I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.
0	427.0		TRUMP	Those are criminal leaks.
0	428.0		TRUMP	They’re put out by people either in agencies.
0	429.0		TRUMP	I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.
0	430.0		TRUMP	You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate.
0	431.0		TRUMP	We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.
0	432.0		TRUMP	So we are looking into that very seriously.
0	433.0		TRUMP	It’s a criminal act.
0	434.0		TRUMP	You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.
0	435.0		TRUMP	Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.
0	436.0		TRUMP	When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised.
0	437.0		TRUMP	But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen.
0	438.0		TRUMP	But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine.
0	439.0		TRUMP	I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way.
0	440.0		TRUMP	Same thing with Australia.
0	441.0		TRUMP	I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important.
0	442.0		TRUMP	But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?
0	443.0		TRUMP	What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East?
0	444.0		TRUMP	Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?
0	445.0		TRUMP	So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public.
0	446.0		TRUMP	And in a way, that was almost a test.
0	447.0		TRUMP	So I’m dealing with Mexico.
0	448.0		TRUMP	I’m dealing with Argentina.
0	449.0		TRUMP	We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.
0	450.0		TRUMP	All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.
0	451.0		TRUMP	And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East?
0	452.0		TRUMP	What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?
0	453.0		TRUMP	We’ve got to stop it.
0	454.0		TRUMP	That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.
0	455.0		TRUMP	Yes, Jon.
0	456.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	457.0		QUESTION	I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.
0	458.0		QUESTION	Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?
0	459.0		QUESTION	And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?
0	460.0		TRUMP	Well, the leaks are real.
0	461.0		TRUMP	You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them.
0	462.0		TRUMP	I mean, the leaks are real.
0	463.0		TRUMP	You know what they said — you saw it.
0	464.0		TRUMP	And the leaks are absolutely real.
0	465.0		TRUMP	The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.
0	466.0		TRUMP	So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters.
0	467.0		TRUMP	It’s very important to me, and especially in this position.
0	468.0		TRUMP	It’s very important.
0	469.0		TRUMP	I don’t mind bad stories.
0	470.0		TRUMP	I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true.
0	471.0		TRUMP	And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that.
0	472.0		TRUMP	But I’m not okay when it is fake.
0	473.0		TRUMP	I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.
0	474.0		TRUMP	I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no.
0	475.0		TRUMP	It’s okay, Jim.
0	476.0		TRUMP	It’s okay, Jim.
0	477.0		TRUMP	You’ll have your chance.
0	478.0		TRUMP	But I watch others too.
0	479.0		TRUMP	You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.
0	480.0		TRUMP	But I think it should be straight.
0	481.0		TRUMP	I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.
0	482.0		TRUMP	I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better.
1	483.0		TRUMP	People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.
0	484.0		TRUMP	I think that’s right.
0	485.0		TRUMP	I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?
0	486.0		TRUMP	Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress.
0	487.0		TRUMP	But honestly, the public would appreciate it.
0	488.0		TRUMP	I’d appreciate it.
0	489.0		TRUMP	Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.
0	490.0		TRUMP	But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.
0	491.0		TRUMP	I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.
0	492.0		TRUMP	I mean, the numbers are crazy.
0	493.0		TRUMP	When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately.
0	494.0		TRUMP	I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.
0	495.0		TRUMP	And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.
0	496.0		TRUMP	And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.
0	497.0		TRUMP	The only thing they can do is delay.
0	498.0		TRUMP	And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.
0	499.0		TRUMP	And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.
0	500.0		TRUMP	And that’s okay.
0	501.0		TRUMP	That’s fine.
0	502.0		TRUMP	But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.
0	503.0		TRUMP	This is pure delay tactics.
0	504.0		TRUMP	And they say it, and everybody understands it.
0	505.0		TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead, Jim.
0	506.0		QUESTION	The first part of my question on contacts.
0	507.0		QUESTION	Do you definitively say that nobody —
0	508.0		TRUMP	Well, I had nothing to do with it.
0	509.0		TRUMP	I have nothing to do with Russia.
0	510.0		TRUMP	I told you, I have no deals there.
0	511.0		TRUMP	I have no anything.
0	512.0		TRUMP	Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give — they’re not giving classified information.
1	513.0		TRUMP	They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates — which, by the way, nobody mentions.
1	514.0		TRUMP	Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.
0	515.0		TRUMP	Can you imagine — seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?
0	516.0		TRUMP	It would be the electric chair, okay?
0	517.0		TRUMP	He should be put in the electric chair. You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?
0	518.0		TRUMP	Maybe not you, Jon.
0	519.0		TRUMP	Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.
0	520.0		TRUMP	I’ll do you next.
0	521.0		TRUMP	Yes?
0	522.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	523.0		QUESTION	I just want to clarify one other thing.
0	524.0		TRUMP	Sure.
0	525.0		QUESTION	Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?
0	526.0		TRUMP	No, I didn’t.
0	527.0		TRUMP	No, I didn’t.
0	528.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	529.0		QUESTION	(Off mic.)
0	530.0		TRUMP	No, I didn’t.
0	531.0		QUESTION	Did you fire him because (inaudible)
0	532.0		TRUMP	Excuse me — no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.
0	533.0		TRUMP	Mike was doing his job.
0	534.0		TRUMP	He was calling countries and his counterparts.
0	535.0		TRUMP	So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.
0	536.0		TRUMP	I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.
0	537.0		TRUMP	I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.
0	538.0		TRUMP	And it came out that way — and, in all fairness, I watched Dr.
0	539.0		TRUMP	Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.
0	540.0		TRUMP	And I agreed with him.
0	541.0		TRUMP	And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.
0	542.0		TRUMP	No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?
0	543.0		TRUMP	Jim.
0	544.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, thank you very much.
0	545.0		QUESTION	And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.
0	546.0		QUESTION	If you could pass that along.
0	547.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	548.0		TRUMP	Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?
0	549.0		QUESTION	If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.
0	550.0		TRUMP	Well, not too many.
0	551.0		TRUMP	We do have other people.
0	552.0		TRUMP	You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.
0	553.0		QUESTION	They’re pretty good right now, actually.
0	554.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	555.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, Jim.
0	556.0		QUESTION	If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.
0	557.0		QUESTION	You welcomed that at one point.
0	558.0		TRUMP	I was okay with it.
0	559.0		QUESTION	You said you loved WikiLeaks.
0	560.0		QUESTION	At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.
0	561.0		QUESTION	I’m wondering, sir, if you —
0	562.0		TRUMP	Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.
0	563.0		QUESTION	Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.
0	564.0		TRUMP	No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.
0	565.0		QUESTION	If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.
0	566.0		TRUMP	Okay, fair question.
0	567.0		TRUMP	Ready?
0	568.0		QUESTION	So if I may ask you that — if I may ask a follow-up —
0	569.0		TRUMP	No, no, but are you — let me do one at a time.
0	570.0		TRUMP	Do you mind?
0	571.0		QUESTION	Yes, sir.
0	572.0		TRUMP	All right.
0	573.0		TRUMP	So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.
0	574.0		TRUMP	In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.
0	575.0		TRUMP	I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.
0	576.0		TRUMP	He said terrible things about her.
0	577.0		TRUMP	But it wasn’t classified information.
0	578.0		TRUMP	But in one case you’re talking about classified.
0	579.0		TRUMP	Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong — at my suggestion — and I give Reince great credit for this — at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.
0	580.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to be hacked.
0	581.0		TRUMP	And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.
0	582.0		TRUMP	The DNC did not do that.
0	583.0		TRUMP	And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.
0	584.0		TRUMP	But they were hacked, and terrible things came.
0	585.0		TRUMP	And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so — they were — when I heard some of those things, I said — I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.
0	586.0		TRUMP	It wasn’t even in the papers.
0	587.0		TRUMP	Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.
0	588.0		TRUMP	I would have been the headline in every newspaper.
0	589.0		TRUMP	I mean, think of it.
0	590.0		TRUMP	They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.
0	591.0		TRUMP	"Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?"
0	592.0		QUESTION	And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about — you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.
0	593.0		QUESTION	I guess I don’t understand.
0	594.0		QUESTION	It seems that there is a disconnect there.
0	595.0		QUESTION	If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?
0	596.0		TRUMP	Well, the reporting is fake.
0	597.0		TRUMP	Look, look —
0	598.0		QUESTION	And if I may ask — I just want to ask one other question.
0	599.0		TRUMP	Jim, you know what it is?
0	600.0		TRUMP	Here’s the thing.
0	601.0		TRUMP	The public isn’t — they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.
0	602.0		TRUMP	They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved.
0	603.0		TRUMP	I’m involved.
0	604.0		TRUMP	I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.
0	605.0		TRUMP	But I’m involved.
0	606.0		TRUMP	So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not.
0	607.0		TRUMP	I just see many, many untruthful things.
0	608.0		TRUMP	And I tell you what else I see.
0	609.0		TRUMP	I see tone.
0	610.0		TRUMP	"You know the word ""tone."""
0	611.0		TRUMP	The tone is such hatred.
0	612.0		TRUMP	I’m really not a bad person, by the way.
0	613.0		TRUMP	No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.
0	614.0		TRUMP	The tone is such hatred.
0	615.0		TRUMP	"I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say ""Fox & Friends"" in the morning, they’re very honorable people."
0	616.0		TRUMP	They’re very — not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.
0	617.0		TRUMP	But they have the most honest morning show.
0	618.0		TRUMP	That’s all I can say.
0	619.0		TRUMP	It’s the most honest.
0	620.0		TRUMP	But the tone, Jim.
0	621.0		TRUMP	If you look — the hatred.
0	622.0		TRUMP	I mean, sometimes — sometimes somebody gets —
0	623.0		QUESTION	(Off mic.)
0	624.0		TRUMP	Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.
0	625.0		TRUMP	You just take a look at that show.
0	626.0		TRUMP	That is a constant hit.
0	627.0		TRUMP	The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.
0	628.0		TRUMP	The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings.
0	629.0		TRUMP	But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.
0	630.0		TRUMP	And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.
0	631.0		TRUMP	Now, I will say this.
0	632.0		TRUMP	I watch it.
0	633.0		TRUMP	I see it.
0	634.0		TRUMP	I’m amazed by it.
0	635.0		TRUMP	And I just think you’d be a lot better off — I honestly do.
0	636.0		TRUMP	The public gets it, you know.
0	637.0		TRUMP	Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.
0	638.0		TRUMP	They want to throw their placards at CNN.
0	639.0		TRUMP	I think you would do much better by being different.
0	640.0		TRUMP	But you just take a look.
0	641.0		TRUMP	Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.
0	642.0		TRUMP	If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.
0	643.0		TRUMP	Now, they’ll take this news conference.
0	644.0		TRUMP	I’m actually having a very good time, okay?
0	645.0		TRUMP	But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget that’s the way I won.
0	646.0		TRUMP	Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.
0	647.0		QUESTION	(Off mic.)
0	648.0		TRUMP	No, that’s how I won.
0	649.0		TRUMP	I won with news conferences and probably speeches.
0	650.0		TRUMP	I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people, that’s for sure.
0	651.0		TRUMP	But I am having a good time.
0	652.0		TRUMP	Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.
0	653.0		TRUMP	I’m not ranting and raving.
0	654.0		TRUMP	I’m just telling you, you’re dishonest people.
0	655.0		TRUMP	But — but I’m not ranting and raving.
0	656.0		TRUMP	I love this.
0	657.0		TRUMP	I’m having a good time doing it.
0	658.0		TRUMP	But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves.
0	659.0		TRUMP	I’m not ranting and raving.
0	660.0		QUESTION	If I may just —
0	661.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	662.0		QUESTION	One more follow-up because —
0	663.0		TRUMP	Should I let him have a little bit more?
0	664.0		TRUMP	What do you think, Peter?
0	665.0		QUESTION	Just because of this —
0	666.0		TRUMP	Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?
0	667.0		TRUMP	Sit down.
0	668.0		TRUMP	Sit down.
0	669.0		QUESTION	Just because of the attack —
0	670.0		TRUMP	We’ll get it.
0	671.0		QUESTION	Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir —
0	672.0		TRUMP	I’m changing it from fake news, though.
0	673.0		QUESTION	Doesn’t that undermine —
0	674.0		TRUMP	Very fake news now.
0	675.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	676.0		QUESTION	But aren’t you —
0	677.0		TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
0	678.0		QUESTION	Real news, Mr. President.
0	679.0		QUESTION	Real news.
0	680.0		TRUMP	And you’re not related to our new —
0	681.0		QUESTION	I am not related, sir, no.
0	682.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	683.0		TRUMP	I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.
0	684.0		TRUMP	I looked — you know, I looked at that name.
0	685.0		TRUMP	I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?
0	686.0		TRUMP	Alex Acosta.
0	687.0		QUESTION	I’m sure you checked that out, sir.
0	688.0		TRUMP	No, I checked it.
0	689.0		TRUMP	I said — they said, no, sir.
0	690.0		TRUMP	I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.
0	691.0		QUESTION	"But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don’t like ""fake news""?"
0	692.0		QUESTION	Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like?
0	693.0		TRUMP	I do that.
0	694.0		QUESTION	When you call it fake news, you’re undermining confidence —
0	695.0		TRUMP	No, I do that.
0	696.0		TRUMP	No, no, I do that.
0	697.0		QUESTION	— in our news media.
0	698.0		TRUMP	Here’s the thing.
0	699.0		QUESTION	Isn’t that important?
0	700.0		TRUMP	Okay, I understand — and you’re right about that except this.
0	701.0		TRUMP	See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.
0	702.0		TRUMP	And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that’s going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.
0	703.0		TRUMP	I know what’s good and bad.
0	704.0		TRUMP	I’d be a pretty good reporter — not as good as you.
0	705.0		TRUMP	But I know what’s good.
0	706.0		TRUMP	I know what’s bad.
0	707.0		TRUMP	And when they change it and make it really bad — something that should be positive.
0	708.0		TRUMP	Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.
0	709.0		TRUMP	They’ll even make it negative.
0	710.0		TRUMP	So I understand it because I’m there.
0	711.0		TRUMP	I know what was said.
0	712.0		TRUMP	I know who is saying it.
0	713.0		TRUMP	I’m there.
0	714.0		TRUMP	So it’s very important to me.
0	715.0		TRUMP	Look, I want to see an honest press.
0	716.0		TRUMP	When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.
0	717.0		TRUMP	The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.
0	718.0		TRUMP	Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don’t know.
0	719.0		TRUMP	But they don’t believe you.
0	720.0		TRUMP	If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?
0	721.0		TRUMP	Of course, he had some questions also.
0	722.0		TRUMP	But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world — including bad stories about me.
0	723.0		TRUMP	But if you go — as an example, you’re CNN — I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.
0	724.0		TRUMP	I won.
0	725.0		TRUMP	I won.
0	726.0		TRUMP	And the other thing: Chaos.
0	727.0		TRUMP	There’s zero chaos.
0	728.0		TRUMP	We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine.
0	729.0		TRUMP	And Reince happens to be doing a good job.
0	730.0		TRUMP	But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.
0	731.0		TRUMP	I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.
0	732.0		TRUMP	But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.
0	733.0		TRUMP	And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.
0	734.0		TRUMP	I mean, we won the election, right?
0	735.0		TRUMP	We won the presidency.
0	736.0		TRUMP	We got some senators.
0	737.0		TRUMP	We got some — all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.
0	738.0		TRUMP	And I said to myself, you know — and I said to somebody that was in the room — I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.
0	739.0		TRUMP	They’re fake.
0	740.0		TRUMP	They’re not true.
0	741.0		TRUMP	And isn’t that a shame, because he’d rather be working on health care.
0	742.0		TRUMP	He’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim.
0	743.0		TRUMP	I mean that.
0	744.0		TRUMP	I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.
0	745.0		TRUMP	I sort of understand there’s a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody — for whatever reason.
0	746.0		TRUMP	And I understand that.
0	747.0		TRUMP	But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair.
0	748.0		TRUMP	And that’s why the public sees it — they see it.
0	749.0		TRUMP	They see it’s not fair.
0	750.0		TRUMP	You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.
0	751.0		TRUMP	And the public is smart.
0	752.0		TRUMP	They understand it.
0	753.0		TRUMP	Okay, yeah, go ahead.
0	754.0		QUESTION	We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).
0	755.0		QUESTION	But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news?
0	756.0		QUESTION	And secondly —
0	757.0		TRUMP	I think they don’t believe it.
0	758.0		TRUMP	I don’t think the public would.
0	759.0		TRUMP	That’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.
0	760.0		TRUMP	I don’t think they believe it.
0	761.0		TRUMP	Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing — that’s a ruse.
0	762.0		TRUMP	That’s a ruse.
0	763.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.
0	764.0		TRUMP	Now, tomorrow you’ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.
0	765.0		TRUMP	It’s not terrible — it’s good.
0	766.0		TRUMP	We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.
1	767.0		TRUMP	We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.
0	768.0		TRUMP	You know what uranium is, right?
0	769.0		TRUMP	It’s this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.
0	770.0		TRUMP	Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.
0	771.0		TRUMP	Nobody talks about that.
0	772.0		TRUMP	I didn’t do anything for Russia.
0	773.0		TRUMP	I’ve done nothing for Russia.
1	774.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.
0	775.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?
0	776.0		TRUMP	Here, take a look.
0	777.0		TRUMP	He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?
0	778.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton — that was a reset.
0	779.0		TRUMP	Remember?
0	780.0		TRUMP	"It said ""reset."""
0	781.0		TRUMP	Now, if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy.
0	782.0		TRUMP	If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing.
0	783.0		TRUMP	We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.
0	784.0		TRUMP	And I told him, I said, I know politically it’s probably not good for me.
0	785.0		TRUMP	Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water.
0	786.0		TRUMP	Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it’s so great.
0	787.0		TRUMP	That’s not great.
0	788.0		TRUMP	That’s not great.
0	789.0		TRUMP	I would love to be able to get along with Russia.
0	790.0		TRUMP	Now, you’ve had a lot of Presidents that haven’t taken that tact.
0	791.0		TRUMP	Look where we are now.
0	792.0		TRUMP	Look where we are now.
0	793.0		TRUMP	So, if I can — now, I love to negotiate things.
0	794.0		TRUMP	I do it really well and all that stuff, but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.
0	795.0		TRUMP	Maybe it is.
0	796.0		TRUMP	But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people — the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.
0	797.0		TRUMP	And probably Putin said, you know — he’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it’s got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.
0	798.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	799.0		TRUMP	And that’s a shame.
0	800.0		TRUMP	Because if we could get along with Russia — and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone — if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.
0	801.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, since you —
0	802.0		TRUMP	Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.
0	803.0		TRUMP	We’re doing Obamacare — we’re in final stages.
0	804.0		TRUMP	We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.
0	805.0		TRUMP	And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.
0	806.0		TRUMP	It’s not like — frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.
0	807.0		TRUMP	So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.
0	808.0		TRUMP	And after that, we’re going to come up — and we’re doing very well on tax reform.
0	809.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	810.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.
0	811.0		QUESTION	Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.
0	812.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	813.0		QUESTION	You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.
0	814.0		TRUMP	Not good.
0	815.0		QUESTION	There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation —
0	816.0		TRUMP	Not good.
0	817.0		QUESTION	— of the agreement between the two countries.
0	818.0		QUESTION	And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.
0	819.0		TRUMP	Not good.
0	820.0		QUESTION	I listened to you during the campaign —
0	821.0		TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?
0	822.0		TRUMP	It happened when — if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States.
0	823.0		TRUMP	There’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the — you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn’t that wonderful.
0	824.0		TRUMP	But I know you well enough.
0	825.0		TRUMP	Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn’t have done that.
0	826.0		TRUMP	Look, of all —
0	827.0		QUESTION	I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those —
0	828.0		TRUMP	Wait a minute.
0	829.0		TRUMP	Wait, wait.
0	830.0		TRUMP	Excuse me just one second.
0	831.0		QUESTION	I’m just trying to find out what you’re doing to do about them, Mr. President.
0	832.0		TRUMP	All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal.
0	833.0		TRUMP	So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.
0	834.0		TRUMP	They all tried.
0	835.0		TRUMP	But I’m different than those people.
0	836.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	837.0		QUESTION	How are you interpreting those moves?
0	838.0		QUESTION	And what do you intend to do about them?
0	839.0		TRUMP	Just the way I said it.
0	840.0		QUESTION	Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?
0	841.0		TRUMP	I have.
0	842.0		TRUMP	I have.
0	843.0		TRUMP	And I’m so beautifully represented.
0	844.0		TRUMP	I’m so honored that the Senate approved him.
0	845.0		TRUMP	He’s going to be fantastic.
0	846.0		TRUMP	Yes, I think that I’ve already —
0	847.0		QUESTION	Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?
0	848.0		TRUMP	No, I don’t think so.
0	849.0		TRUMP	I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.
0	850.0		TRUMP	I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now.
0	851.0		TRUMP	Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal.
0	852.0		TRUMP	Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal.
0	853.0		TRUMP	I don’t know.
0	854.0		TRUMP	We might, we might not.
0	855.0		TRUMP	But it would be much easier for me to be so tough — the tougher I am on Russia, the better.
0	856.0		TRUMP	But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.
0	857.0		TRUMP	And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.
0	858.0		TRUMP	If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.
0	859.0		TRUMP	There’s no upside.
0	860.0		TRUMP	We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.
0	861.0		TRUMP	I’ve been briefed.
0	862.0		TRUMP	And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.
0	863.0		TRUMP	They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.
0	864.0		TRUMP	If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.
0	865.0		QUESTION	So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are —
0	866.0		TRUMP	Who did I say is not good?
0	867.0		QUESTION	No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they’re not good.
0	868.0		TRUMP	No, it’s not good, but they happened.
0	869.0		QUESTION	But do they damage the relationship?
0	870.0		QUESTION	Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?
0	871.0		TRUMP	They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.
0	872.0		TRUMP	Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.
0	873.0		TRUMP	And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?
0	874.0		TRUMP	Does anybody in this room really believe that?
0	875.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	876.0		TRUMP	But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal.
0	877.0		TRUMP	She had the reset.
0	878.0		TRUMP	She gave all the valuable uranium away.
0	879.0		TRUMP	She did other things.
0	880.0		TRUMP	You know, they say I’m close to Russia.
0	881.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.
0	882.0		TRUMP	She’s close to Russia.
0	883.0		TRUMP	I gave — you know what I gave to Russia?
0	884.0		TRUMP	You know what I gave?
0	885.0		TRUMP	Nothing.
0	886.0		QUESTION	Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?
0	887.0		TRUMP	I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.
0	888.0		TRUMP	I don’t talk about military response.
0	889.0		TRUMP	I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.
0	890.0		TRUMP	"We are going to attack Mosul in four months. Then three months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult."
0	891.0		TRUMP	Do you know why?
0	892.0		TRUMP	Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.
0	893.0		TRUMP	You’re going to be surprised to hear that.
0	894.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.
0	895.0		TRUMP	So I don’t have to tell you —
0	896.0		QUESTION	There will be a response?
0	897.0		TRUMP	"I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here’s what we’re going to do."""
0	898.0		TRUMP	 I don’t have to do that.
0	899.0		QUESTION	There will be a — in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?
0	900.0		TRUMP	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.
0	901.0		TRUMP	Wait a minute.
0	902.0		TRUMP	I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.
0	903.0		TRUMP	And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.
0	904.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	905.0		TRUMP	Because they shouldn’t know.
0	906.0		TRUMP	And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.
0	907.0		TRUMP	So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship — the Russian ship, as an example — I’m not going to tell you.
0	908.0		TRUMP	But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.
0	909.0		TRUMP	But I’m not going to tell you.
0	910.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	911.0		QUESTION	Thanks.
0	912.0		QUESTION	Can I just ask you — thank you very much, Mr. President — the Trump —
0	913.0		TRUMP	Where are you from?
0	914.0		QUESTION	BBC.
0	915.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	916.0		TRUMP	Here’s another beauty.
0	917.0		QUESTION	That’s a good line.
0	918.0		QUESTION	Impartial, free, and fair.
0	919.0		TRUMP	Yeah, sure.
0	920.0		QUESTION	Mr. President —
0	921.0		TRUMP	Just like CNN, right?
0	922.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, on the travel ban — we could banter back and forth.
0	923.0		QUESTION	On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned —
0	924.0		TRUMP	Yeah, I do.
0	925.0		TRUMP	I do.
0	926.0		TRUMP	And let me tell you about the travel —
0	927.0		QUESTION	Were there any mistakes in that?
0	928.0		TRUMP	Wait, wait, wait.
0	929.0		TRUMP	I know who you are.
0	930.0		TRUMP	Just wait.
0	931.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you about the travel ban.
0	932.0		TRUMP	We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.
0	933.0		TRUMP	We got a bad decision.
0	934.0		TRUMP	We had a court that’s been overturned — again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.
0	935.0		TRUMP	A lot.
0	936.0		TRUMP	We had a bad decision.
0	937.0		TRUMP	We’re going to keep going with that decision.
0	938.0		TRUMP	We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.
0	939.0		TRUMP	But we had a bad decision.
0	940.0		TRUMP	That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.
0	941.0		TRUMP	You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.
0	942.0		TRUMP	You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.
0	943.0		TRUMP	Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.
0	944.0		TRUMP	We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.
0	945.0		TRUMP	Very bad for the safety and security of our country.
0	946.0		TRUMP	The rollout was perfect.
0	947.0		TRUMP	Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing — and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time.
0	948.0		TRUMP	But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month — the bad ones.
0	949.0		TRUMP	You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?
0	950.0		TRUMP	They’re not everybody that’s like you.
0	951.0		TRUMP	You have some bad people out there.
0	952.0		TRUMP	So Kelly said, you can’t do that.
0	953.0		TRUMP	And he was right.
0	954.0		TRUMP	As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.
0	955.0		TRUMP	I said, how about one week?
0	956.0		TRUMP	He said, no good.
0	957.0		TRUMP	You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.
0	958.0		TRUMP	Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.
0	959.0		TRUMP	Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.
0	960.0		TRUMP	The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.
0	961.0		TRUMP	Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.
0	962.0		TRUMP	Very, very strongly.
0	963.0		TRUMP	But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.
0	964.0		QUESTION	Just a brief follow-up.
0	965.0		QUESTION	And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce —
0	966.0		TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
0	967.0		QUESTION	Thank you.
0	968.0		QUESTION	I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.
0	969.0		QUESTION	Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?
0	970.0		TRUMP	Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.
0	971.0		TRUMP	So that’s one person.
0	972.0		TRUMP	But he was dealing — as he should have been —
0	973.0		QUESTION	During the election?
0	974.0		TRUMP	No, no, nobody that I know of.
0	975.0		QUESTION	So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?
0	976.0		TRUMP	Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?
0	977.0		QUESTION	Can you just say yes or no on it?
0	978.0		TRUMP	Russia is a ruse.
0	979.0		TRUMP	Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.
0	980.0		TRUMP	Russia is a ruse.
0	981.0		TRUMP	I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.
0	982.0		TRUMP	Don’t speak to people from Russia.
0	983.0		TRUMP	Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.
0	984.0		TRUMP	I spoke to Putin twice.
0	985.0		TRUMP	He called me on the election — I told you this — and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.
0	986.0		TRUMP	We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time.
0	987.0		TRUMP	I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.
0	988.0		TRUMP	But we had a very, very good talk.
0	989.0		TRUMP	I have nothing to do with Russia.
0	990.0		TRUMP	To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.
0	991.0		TRUMP	Now, Manafort has totally denied it.
0	992.0		TRUMP	He denied it.
0	993.0		TRUMP	Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.
0	994.0		TRUMP	I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that — whoever.
0	995.0		TRUMP	But people knew that.
0	996.0		TRUMP	Everybody knew that.
0	997.0		QUESTION	But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?
0	998.0		TRUMP	I have — you know what, he said no.
0	999.0		TRUMP	I can only tell you what he — now, he was replaced long before the election.
0	1000.0		TRUMP	You know that, right?
0	1001.0		TRUMP	He was replaced long before the election.
0	1002.0		TRUMP	When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.
0	1003.0		TRUMP	But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way — Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.
0	1004.0		TRUMP	He was only there for a short period of time.
0	1005.0		TRUMP	How much longer should we stay here, folks?
0	1006.0		TRUMP	Five more minutes, is that okay?
0	1007.0		TRUMP	Five?
0	1008.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, on national security —
0	1009.0		TRUMP	Wait, let’s see, who’s — I want to find a friendly reporter.
0	1010.0		TRUMP	Are you a friendly reporter?
0	1011.0		TRUMP	Watch how friendly he is.
0	1012.0		TRUMP	Wait, wait — watch how friendly he is.
0	1013.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1014.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1015.0		QUESTION	So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.
0	1016.0		QUESTION	And (inaudible).
0	1017.0		QUESTION	I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the — anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.
0	1018.0		QUESTION	We have an understanding of (inaudible).
0	1019.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1020.0		QUESTION	However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.
0	1021.0		QUESTION	There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.
0	1022.0		QUESTION	There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to —
0	1023.0		TRUMP	You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.
0	1024.0		TRUMP	And it’s not.
0	1025.0		TRUMP	It’s not.
0	1026.0		TRUMP	Not a simple question, not a fair question.
0	1027.0		TRUMP	Okay, sit down.
0	1028.0		TRUMP	I understand the rest of your question.
0	1029.0		TRUMP	So here’s the story, folks.
0	1030.0		TRUMP	Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.
0	1031.0		TRUMP	Number two, racism — the least racist person.
0	1032.0		TRUMP	In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.
0	1033.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	1034.0		TRUMP	Quiet, quiet, quiet.
0	1035.0		TRUMP	See, he lied about — he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.
0	1036.0		TRUMP	So you know, welcome to the world of the media.
0	1037.0		TRUMP	But let me just tell you something — that I hate the charge.
0	1038.0		TRUMP	I find it repulsive.
0	1039.0		TRUMP	I hate even the question because people that know me — and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday — did you hear him, Bibi?
0	1040.0		TRUMP	He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.
0	1041.0		TRUMP	So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.
0	1042.0		TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead.
0	1043.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1044.0		QUESTION	Thank you.
0	1045.0		QUESTION	I’m Lisa from the PBS —
0	1046.0		TRUMP	See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.
0	1047.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	1048.0		QUESTION	Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.
0	1049.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	1050.0		QUESTION	On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?
0	1051.0		QUESTION	Will it be focused on specific countries?
0	1052.0		TRUMP	It’s a very fair question.
0	1053.0		QUESTION	And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?
0	1054.0		QUESTION	Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?
0	1055.0		TRUMP	We’re going to show great heart.
0	1056.0		TRUMP	DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.
0	1057.0		TRUMP	To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases — not in all cases.
0	1058.0		TRUMP	In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.
0	1059.0		TRUMP	But you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly — they were brought here in such a way — it’s a very, very tough subject.
0	1060.0		TRUMP	We are going to deal with DACA with heart.
0	1061.0		TRUMP	I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget, and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right.
0	1062.0		TRUMP	And I appreciate your understanding on that.
0	1063.0		TRUMP	But the DACA situation is a very, very — it’s a very difficult thing for me.
0	1064.0		TRUMP	Because, you know, I love these kids.
0	1065.0		TRUMP	I love kids.
0	1066.0		TRUMP	I have kids and grandkids.
0	1067.0		TRUMP	And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.
0	1068.0		TRUMP	And you know, the law is rough.
0	1069.0		TRUMP	I’m not talking about new laws.
0	1070.0		TRUMP	I’m talking the existing law is very rough.
0	1071.0		TRUMP	It’s very, very rough.
0	1072.0		TRUMP	As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.
0	1073.0		TRUMP	But we’re tailoring it now to the decision.
0	1074.0		TRUMP	We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.
0	1075.0		TRUMP	And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.
0	1076.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	1077.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.
0	1078.0		QUESTION	President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.
0	1079.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	1080.0		QUESTION	And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.
0	1081.0		QUESTION	Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?
0	1082.0		QUESTION	And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?
0	1083.0		TRUMP	Now, that’s what I call a nice question.
0	1084.0		TRUMP	That is very nice.
0	1085.0		TRUMP	Who are you with?
0	1086.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	1087.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	1088.0		TRUMP	I’m going to start watching.
0	1089.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	1090.0		TRUMP	Melania is terrific.
0	1091.0		TRUMP	She was here last night.
0	1092.0		TRUMP	We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.
0	1093.0		TRUMP	And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.
0	1094.0		TRUMP	And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.
0	1095.0		TRUMP	And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.
0	1096.0		TRUMP	That’s right, she just opened up the Visitors Center — in other words, touring of the White House.
0	1097.0		TRUMP	She, like others that she’s working with, feels very, very strongly about women’s issues, women’s difficulties, very, very strongly.
0	1098.0		TRUMP	And she’s a very, very strong advocate.
0	1099.0		TRUMP	I think she’s a great representative for this country.
0	1100.0		TRUMP	And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.
0	1101.0		TRUMP	The things they say — I’ve known her for a long time.
0	1102.0		TRUMP	She was a very successful person.
0	1103.0		TRUMP	She was a very successful model.
0	1104.0		TRUMP	She did really well.
0	1105.0		TRUMP	She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people.
0	1106.0		TRUMP	She was a very private person.
0	1107.0		TRUMP	She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find.
0	1108.0		TRUMP	And the things they say — and I’ve known her for a long time — the things they say are so unfair.
0	1109.0		TRUMP	And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.
0	1110.0		TRUMP	I’d just tell you this: I think she’s going to be a fantastic First Lady.
0	1111.0		TRUMP	She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.
0	1112.0		TRUMP	And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.
0	1113.0		TRUMP	And they’re not doing this for money.
0	1114.0		TRUMP	They’re not doing this for pay.
0	1115.0		TRUMP	They’re doing this because they feel it, both of them.
0	1116.0		TRUMP	And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school — because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left — she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.
0	1117.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1118.0		TRUMP	That’s a very nice question.
0	1119.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1120.0		QUESTION	Mr. President.
0	1121.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	1122.0		TRUMP	Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that’s okay.
0	1123.0		QUESTION	No, it’s not going to be a bad question.
0	1124.0		TRUMP	Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.
0	1125.0		QUESTION	Well, thank you so much.
0	1126.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, I need to find out from you — you said something as it relates to inner cities.
0	1127.0		QUESTION	That was one of your platforms during your campaign.
0	1128.0		TRUMP	Fix the inner cities, yes.
0	1129.0		QUESTION	Fixing the inner cities.
0	1130.0		QUESTION	What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that’s coming out this afternoon?
0	1131.0		QUESTION	See, it wasn’t bad, was it?
0	1132.0		TRUMP	That was very professional and very good.
0	1133.0		QUESTION	I’m very professional.
0	1134.0		TRUMP	We’ll be announcing the order in a little while, and I’d rather let the order speak for itself.
0	1135.0		TRUMP	But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.
0	1136.0		TRUMP	But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.
0	1137.0		TRUMP	As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.
0	1138.0		TRUMP	I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.
0	1139.0		TRUMP	We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.
0	1140.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.
0	1141.0		TRUMP	So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.
0	1142.0		TRUMP	We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible — you know it takes a long time.
0	1143.0		TRUMP	It’s taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.
0	1144.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.
0	1145.0		TRUMP	And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.
0	1146.0		TRUMP	You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime.
0	1147.0		TRUMP	You have people — and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it.
0	1148.0		TRUMP	In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.
0	1149.0		TRUMP	They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.
0	1150.0		TRUMP	They’re living in hell.
0	1151.0		TRUMP	We can’t let that happen.
0	1152.0		TRUMP	So we’re going to be very, very strong.
0	1153.0		TRUMP	It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.
0	1154.0		TRUMP	It’s been festering for many, many years.
0	1155.0		TRUMP	But we have places in this country that we have to fix.
0	1156.0		TRUMP	We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there — Hispanic American people.
0	1157.0		TRUMP	We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell.
0	1158.0		TRUMP	I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.
0	1159.0		TRUMP	There are two Chicagos, as you know.
0	1160.0		TRUMP	There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.
0	1161.0		TRUMP	There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.
0	1162.0		TRUMP	So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.
0	1163.0		TRUMP	I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.
0	1164.0		QUESTION	Well, when you say — when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr.
0	1165.0		QUESTION	President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your —
0	1166.0		TRUMP	Am I going include who?
0	1167.0		QUESTION	Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as —
0	1168.0		TRUMP	Well, I would.
0	1169.0		TRUMP	I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?
0	1170.0		TRUMP	Do you want to set up the meeting?
0	1171.0		QUESTION	No, no, no.
0	1172.0		TRUMP	Are they friends of yours?
0	1173.0		QUESTION	I’m just a reporter.
0	1174.0		TRUMP	No, go ahead, set up the meeting.
0	1175.0		QUESTION	I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.
0	1176.0		TRUMP	Let’s go set up a meeting.
0	1177.0		TRUMP	I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.
0	1178.0		TRUMP	I think it’s great — the Congressional Black Caucus.
0	1179.0		TRUMP	I think it’s great.
0	1180.0		TRUMP	I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting.
0	1181.0		TRUMP	I was all set to have the meeting.
0	1182.0		TRUMP	You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.
0	1183.0		TRUMP	I spoke to him on the phone.
0	1184.0		TRUMP	Very nice guy.
0	1185.0		QUESTION	I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.
0	1186.0		TRUMP	He wanted it.
0	1187.0		TRUMP	But we called, called, called, called — they can’t make a meeting with him.
0	1188.0		TRUMP	Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.
0	1189.0		TRUMP	Because I do want to solve the problem.
0	1190.0		TRUMP	But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told — he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.
0	1191.0		TRUMP	And that’s part of the problem of this country.
0	1192.0		TRUMP	Okay, one more.
0	1193.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1194.0		QUESTION	Yes, Mr. President, two questions —
0	1195.0		TRUMP	No, no.
0	1196.0		TRUMP	One question.
0	1197.0		TRUMP	Two, we can’t handle.
0	1198.0		TRUMP	This room can’t handle two.
0	1199.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, give me the better of your two.
0	1200.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible)
0	1201.0		QUESTION	it’s not about your personality or your beliefs.
0	1202.0		QUESTION	We’re talking about (inaudible)
0	1203.0		QUESTION	around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.
0	1204.0		QUESTION	What do you —
0	1205.0		TRUMP	And some of it — and can I be honest with you?
0	1206.0		TRUMP	And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.
0	1207.0		TRUMP	Some of it written by our opponents.
0	1208.0		TRUMP	You do know that.
0	1209.0		TRUMP	Do you understand that?
0	1210.0		TRUMP	You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.
0	1211.0		TRUMP	Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.
0	1212.0		TRUMP	No.
0	1213.0		TRUMP	But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.
0	1214.0		TRUMP	They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.
0	1215.0		TRUMP	It won’t be my people.
0	1216.0		TRUMP	It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.
0	1217.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1218.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1219.0		QUESTION	You are the President now.
0	1220.0		QUESTION	What are you going to do about it?
0	1221.0		TRUMP	Where is that?
0	1222.0		TRUMP	Oh, stand up.
0	1223.0		TRUMP	You can —
0	1224.0		QUESTION	What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?
0	1225.0		TRUMP	Oh, I’m working on it.
0	1226.0		TRUMP	No, I’m working on it very hard.
0	1227.0		QUESTION	Are you going to give a speech?
0	1228.0		TRUMP	No, no, look.
0	1229.0		TRUMP	Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.
0	1230.0		TRUMP	Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.
0	1231.0		TRUMP	I didn’t come along and divide this country.
0	1232.0		TRUMP	This country was seriously divided before I got here.
0	1233.0		TRUMP	We’re going to work on it very hard.
0	1234.0		TRUMP	One of the questions that was asked — I thought it was a very good question — was about the inner cities.
0	1235.0		TRUMP	I mean, that’s part of it.
0	1236.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to work on education.
0	1237.0		TRUMP	We’re going to work on lack — you know, we’re going to stop — we’re going to try and stop the crime.
0	1238.0		TRUMP	We have great law enforcement officials.
0	1239.0		TRUMP	We’re going to try and stop crime.
0	1240.0		TRUMP	We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime.
0	1241.0		TRUMP	But it’s very important to me.
0	1242.0		TRUMP	But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.
0	1243.0		TRUMP	We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama.
0	1244.0		TRUMP	We lived in a divided nation.
0	1245.0		TRUMP	And I am going to try — I will do everything within my power to fix that.
0	1246.0		TRUMP	I want to thank everybody very much.
0	1247.0		TRUMP	It’s a great honor to be with you.
0	1248.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1249.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	1250.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	2.0		TRUMP	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States —
0	3.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	4.0		TRUMP	 — and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation’s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.
0	5.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	6.0		TRUMP	Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.
0	7.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	8.0		TRUMP	Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.
0	9.0		TRUMP	That torch is now in our hands.
0	10.0		TRUMP	And we will use it to light up the world.
0	11.0		TRUMP	I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
0	12.0		TRUMP	A new chapter —
0	13.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	14.0		TRUMP	— of American Greatness is now beginning.
0	15.0		TRUMP	A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.
0	16.0		TRUMP	And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.
0	17.0		TRUMP	What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.
0	18.0		TRUMP	Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.
0	19.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	20.0		TRUMP	All the nations of the world — friend or foe — will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.
0	21.0		TRUMP	In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding — 250 years since the day we declared our independence.
0	22.0		TRUMP	It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.
0	23.0		TRUMP	But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?
0	24.0		TRUMP	What kind of country will we leave for our children?
0	25.0		TRUMP	I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
0	26.0		TRUMP	For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.
0	27.0		TRUMP	We’ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.
1	28.0		TRUMP	We’ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.
0	29.0		TRUMP	And we’ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
0	30.0		TRUMP	Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet.
0	31.0		TRUMP	The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds — families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.
0	32.0		TRUMP	But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
0	33.0		TRUMP	Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.
0	34.0		TRUMP	Because only then can we truly make America great again.
0	35.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	36.0		TRUMP	Dying industries will come roaring back to life.
0	37.0		TRUMP	Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.
0	38.0		TRUMP	Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
0	39.0		TRUMP	Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.
0	40.0		TRUMP	Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop.
0	41.0		TRUMP	And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
0	42.0		TRUMP	Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.
0	43.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	44.0		TRUMP	It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises.
1	45.0		TRUMP	Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.
0	46.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	47.0		TRUMP	The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record.
0	48.0		TRUMP	We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic — and it is a fantastic — new F-35 jet fighter, and we’ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.
0	49.0		TRUMP	We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.
0	50.0		TRUMP	We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban —
0	51.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	52.0		TRUMP	— thank you — and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.
0	53.0		TRUMP	We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency.
0	54.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	55.0		TRUMP	And we’re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.
0	56.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	57.0		TRUMP	We’re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.
0	58.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	59.0		TRUMP	We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines —
0	60.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	61.0		TRUMP	— thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.
0	62.0		TRUMP	And I’ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.
0	63.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	64.0		TRUMP	We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
0	65.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	66.0		TRUMP	And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
0	67.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	68.0		TRUMP	To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.
0	69.0		TRUMP	I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.
0	70.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	71.0		TRUMP	We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
0	72.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	73.0		TRUMP	At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
0	74.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	75.0		TRUMP	By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.
0	76.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	77.0		TRUMP	We want all Americans to succeed, but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.
0	78.0		TRUMP	We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.
0	79.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	80.0		TRUMP	For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.
0	81.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	82.0		TRUMP	As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.
0	83.0		TRUMP	Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.
0	84.0		TRUMP	To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question:  What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?
0	85.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	86.0		TRUMP	Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.
0	87.0		TRUMP	We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.
0	88.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	89.0		TRUMP	According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.
0	90.0		TRUMP	We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.
0	91.0		TRUMP	We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world.
1	92.0		TRUMP	It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.
0	93.0		TRUMP	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
1	94.0		TRUMP	It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.
0	95.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	96.0		TRUMP	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
0	97.0		TRUMP	We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.
0	98.0		TRUMP	We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
0	99.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	100.0		TRUMP	That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm.
0	101.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	102.0		TRUMP	As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs.
0	103.0		TRUMP	We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.
0	104.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	105.0		TRUMP	I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.
0	106.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	107.0		TRUMP	Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.
0	108.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	109.0		TRUMP	I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.
0	110.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	111.0		TRUMP	Thank you, Maureen.
0	112.0		TRUMP	Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.
0	113.0		TRUMP	To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.
0	114.0		TRUMP	He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.
0	115.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	116.0		TRUMP	Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.
1	117.0		TRUMP	Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.
0	118.0		TRUMP	Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.
1	119.0		TRUMP	More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.
0	120.0		TRUMP	We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.
0	121.0		TRUMP	In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.
0	122.0		TRUMP	We’ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we’ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
0	123.0		TRUMP	Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.
0	124.0		TRUMP	And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
0	125.0		TRUMP	Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.
0	126.0		TRUMP	It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
0	127.0		TRUMP	But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy — making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.
0	128.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	129.0		TRUMP	Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.
0	130.0		TRUMP	My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
0	131.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	132.0		TRUMP	It will be a big, big cut.
0	133.0		TRUMP	At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
0	134.0		TRUMP	We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.
0	135.0		TRUMP	We have to do it.
0	136.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	137.0		TRUMP	Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes.
0	138.0		TRUMP	But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.
0	139.0		TRUMP	I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.
0	140.0		TRUMP	In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.
0	141.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	142.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	143.0		TRUMP	And they wanted me to ride one and I said, “No, thank you.”
0	144.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	145.0		TRUMP	At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?
0	146.0		TRUMP	They said that it’s good.
0	147.0		TRUMP	I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?
0	148.0		TRUMP	They told me — without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they’ve become used to it — that it’s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.
0	149.0		TRUMP	They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
0	150.0		TRUMP	They weren’t even asking for a change.
0	151.0		TRUMP	But I am.
0	152.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	153.0		TRUMP	I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.
0	154.0		TRUMP	It’s been a long time since we had fair trade.
0	155.0		TRUMP	The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people.”
0	156.0		TRUMP	Lincoln was right — and it’s time we heeded his advice and his words.
0	157.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	158.0		TRUMP	I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.
0	159.0		TRUMP	They have taken advantage of our country.
0	160.0		TRUMP	No longer.
0	161.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	162.0		TRUMP	I am going to bring back millions of jobs.
0	163.0		TRUMP	Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.
0	164.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	165.0		TRUMP	The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.
0	166.0		TRUMP	Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.
0	167.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	168.0		TRUMP	It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.
0	169.0		TRUMP	Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.
1	170.0		TRUMP	According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.
0	171.0		TRUMP	Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.
0	172.0		TRUMP	It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class.
0	173.0		TRUMP	And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.
0	174.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	175.0		TRUMP	I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation’s security; and to restore respect for our laws.
0	176.0		TRUMP	If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
0	177.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	178.0		TRUMP	Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program — the building of the Interstate Highway System.
0	179.0		TRUMP	The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.
0	180.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	181.0		TRUMP	America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.
0	182.0		TRUMP	With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country – twice.
0	183.0		TRUMP	And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.
0	184.0		TRUMP	To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States — financed through both public and private capital — creating millions of new jobs.
0	185.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	186.0		TRUMP	This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.
0	187.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	188.0		TRUMP	Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare —
0	189.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	190.0		TRUMP	— with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.
0	191.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	192.0		TRUMP	Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.
0	193.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	194.0		TRUMP	The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.
0	195.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	196.0		TRUMP	Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.
1	197.0		TRUMP	As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.
1	198.0		TRUMP	Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State — it is unsustainable and collapsing.
0	199.0		TRUMP	One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.
0	200.0		TRUMP	They are losing them so fast.
0	201.0		TRUMP	They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all.
0	202.0		TRUMP	There’s no choice left.
0	203.0		TRUMP	Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?
0	204.0		TRUMP	We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.
0	205.0		TRUMP	Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.
0	206.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	207.0		TRUMP	Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.
0	208.0		TRUMP	So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
0	209.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	210.0		TRUMP	Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:
0	211.0		TRUMP	First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.
0	212.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	213.0		TRUMP	Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.
0	214.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	215.0		TRUMP	Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.
0	216.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	217.0		TRUMP	Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.
0	218.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	219.0		TRUMP	And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines —
0	220.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	221.0		TRUMP	which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.
0	222.0		TRUMP	So important.
0	223.0		TRUMP	Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.
0	224.0		TRUMP	Every problem can be solved.
0	225.0		TRUMP	And every hurting family can find healing and hope.
0	226.0		TRUMP	Our citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?
0	227.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	228.0		TRUMP	On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.
0	229.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	230.0		TRUMP	My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
0	231.0		TRUMP	True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.
0	232.0		TRUMP	An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all.
0	233.0		TRUMP	Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.
0	234.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	235.0		TRUMP	Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.
0	236.0		TRUMP	She was not expected to live past five.
0	237.0		TRUMP	On receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.
0	238.0		TRUMP	He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.
0	239.0		TRUMP	Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.
0	240.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	241.0		TRUMP	Megan’s story is about the unbounded power of a father’s love for a daughter.
0	242.0		TRUMP	But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan’s life, from reaching those in need.
0	243.0		TRUMP	If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.
0	244.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	245.0		TRUMP	In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.
0	246.0		TRUMP	But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child.
0	247.0		TRUMP	Education is the civil rights issue of our time.
0	248.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	249.0		TRUMP	I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children.
0	250.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	251.0		TRUMP	These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.
0	252.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	253.0		TRUMP	Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
0	254.0		TRUMP	As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.
0	255.0		TRUMP	But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning — a great learning center — with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.
0	256.0		TRUMP	Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.
0	257.0		TRUMP	Later this year she will get her master’s degree in social work.
0	258.0		TRUMP	We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.
0	259.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	260.0		TRUMP	But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
1	261.0		TRUMP	The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.
0	262.0		TRUMP	In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
0	263.0		TRUMP	This is not acceptable in our society.
0	264.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	265.0		TRUMP	Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.
0	266.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	267.0		TRUMP	But to create this future, we must work with, not against — not against — the men and women of law enforcement.
0	268.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	269.0		TRUMP	We must build bridges of cooperation and trust — not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it’s what it is, division.
0	270.0		TRUMP	It’s pure, unadulterated division.
0	271.0		TRUMP	We have to unify.
0	272.0		TRUMP	Police and sheriffs are members of our community.
0	273.0		TRUMP	They’re friends and neighbors, they’re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters — and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they’ll come home safe and sound.
0	274.0		TRUMP	We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
0	275.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	276.0		TRUMP	And we must support the victims of crime.
0	277.0		TRUMP	I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
0	278.0		TRUMP	The office is called VOICE — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
0	279.0		TRUMP	We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.
0	280.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	281.0		TRUMP	Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
0	282.0		TRUMP	Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.
0	283.0		TRUMP	Jamiel’s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.
0	284.0		TRUMP	Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.
0	285.0		TRUMP	But he never got the chance.
0	286.0		TRUMP	His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.
0	287.0		TRUMP	Jamiel, thank you.
0	288.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	289.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	290.0		TRUMP	Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.
0	291.0		TRUMP	Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California.
0	292.0		TRUMP	They were pillars of their community.
0	293.0		TRUMP	These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
0	294.0		TRUMP	Should have never been in our country.
0	295.0		TRUMP	Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.
0	296.0		TRUMP	Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.
0	297.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	298.0		TRUMP	To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.
0	299.0		TRUMP	Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.
0	300.0		TRUMP	We will always honor their memory.
0	301.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	302.0		TRUMP	Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war — if they must — they have to fight and they only have to win.
0	303.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	304.0		TRUMP	I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester — 
0	305.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	306.0		TRUMP	— and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
0	307.0		TRUMP	My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.
0	308.0		TRUMP	Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.
0	309.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	310.0		TRUMP	The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater.
0	311.0		TRUMP	And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.
0	312.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	313.0		TRUMP	We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens.
0	314.0		TRUMP	Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.
0	315.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	316.0		TRUMP	I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that — and I quote — “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.”
0	317.0		TRUMP	Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity.
0	318.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	319.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	320.0		TRUMP	And Ryan is looking down, right now — you know that — and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.
0	321.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	322.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	323.0		TRUMP	For as the Bible teaches us, “There is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”
0	324.0		TRUMP	Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.
0	325.0		TRUMP	And we will never forget Ryan.
0	326.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	327.0		TRUMP	To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.
0	328.0		TRUMP	Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.
0	329.0		TRUMP	It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.
0	330.0		TRUMP	We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.
0	331.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	332.0		TRUMP	But our partners must meet their financial obligations.
0	333.0		TRUMP	And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.
0	334.0		TRUMP	In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in.
0	335.0		TRUMP	Very nice.
0	336.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	337.0		TRUMP	We expect our partners — whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific — to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.
0	338.0		TRUMP	Have to do that.
0	339.0		TRUMP	We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.
0	340.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	341.0		TRUMP	Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
0	342.0		TRUMP	My job is not to represent the world.
0	343.0		TRUMP	My job is to represent the United States of America.
0	344.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	345.0		TRUMP	But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.
0	346.0		TRUMP	We must learn from the mistakes of the past.
0	347.0		TRUMP	We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world — all across the world.
0	348.0		TRUMP	The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.
0	349.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	350.0		TRUMP	America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.
0	351.0		TRUMP	We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.
0	352.0		TRUMP	We want peace, wherever peace can be found.
0	353.0		TRUMP	America is friends today with former enemies.
0	354.0		TRUMP	Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.
0	355.0		TRUMP	This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
0	356.0		TRUMP	Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.
0	357.0		TRUMP	On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America’s centennial.
0	358.0		TRUMP	At that celebration, the country’s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.
0	359.0		TRUMP	Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
0	360.0		TRUMP	Remington unveiled the first typewriter.
0	361.0		TRUMP	An early attempt was made at electric light.
0	362.0		TRUMP	Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.
0	363.0		TRUMP	Imagine the wonders our country could know in America’s 250th year.
0	364.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	365.0		TRUMP	Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.
0	366.0		TRUMP	Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
0	367.0		TRUMP	American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
1	368.0		TRUMP	Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.
0	369.0		TRUMP	And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.
0	370.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	371.0		TRUMP	When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before — for all Americans.
0	372.0		TRUMP	This is our vision.
0	373.0		TRUMP	This is our mission.
0	374.0		TRUMP	But we can only get there together.
0	375.0		TRUMP	We are one people, with one destiny.
0	376.0		TRUMP	We all bleed the same blood.
0	377.0		TRUMP	We all salute the same great American flag.
0	378.0		TRUMP	And we all are made by the same God.
0	379.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	380.0		TRUMP	When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.
0	381.0		TRUMP	The time for small thinking is over.
0	382.0		TRUMP	The time for trivial fights is behind us.
0	383.0		TRUMP	We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.
0	384.0		TRUMP	From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
0	385.0		TRUMP	I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
0	386.0		TRUMP	I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country.
0	387.0		TRUMP	I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.
0	388.0		TRUMP	Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.
0	389.0		TRUMP	Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.
0	390.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much, everybody.
0	2.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	3.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	4.0		TRUMP	So we’re just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up.
0	5.0		TRUMP	This is some crowd.
0	6.0		TRUMP	You have to see what’s outside, you wouldn’t even believe it.
0	7.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	8.0		TRUMP	Unbelievable.
0	9.0		TRUMP	So I’m thrilled to be here in Nashville, Tennessee, the home —
0	10.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	11.0		TRUMP	— of country music, Southern hospitality, and the great President Andrew Jackson.
0	12.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	13.0		TRUMP	I just came from a tour of Andrew Jackson’s home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth.
0	14.0		TRUMP	Jackson’s life was devoted to one very crucial principle — he understood that real leadership means putting America first.
0	15.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	16.0		TRUMP	Before becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your state from the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia.
0	17.0		TRUMP	Tough cookie.
0	18.0		TRUMP	Tough cookie.
0	19.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	20.0		TRUMP	So let’s begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans.
0	21.0		TRUMP	The veterans.
0	22.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	23.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	24.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	25.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	26.0		TRUMP	Amazing.
0	27.0		TRUMP	There’s no place I’d rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hardworking citizens of our country.
0	28.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	29.0		TRUMP	I would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly — or reporters from Washington, D.C.
0	30.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	31.0		TRUMP	It’s patriotic Americans like you who make this country run, and run well.
0	32.0		TRUMP	You pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars.
0	33.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	34.0		TRUMP	All you want is a government that shows you the same loyalty in return.
0	35.0		TRUMP	It’s time that Washington heard your voice — and believe me, on November 8th, they heard your voice.
0	36.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	37.0		TRUMP	The forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me.
0	38.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	39.0		TRUMP	I want to thank so many of your state leaders — State Party Chairman Scott Golden; Congressman Scott DesJarlais; Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn; Congresswoman Diane Black; Congressman Jimmy Duncan — right from the beginning.
0	40.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	41.0		TRUMP	Governor Bill Haslam.
0	42.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	43.0		TRUMP	A great friend of mine, Senator Bob Corker.
0	44.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	45.0		TRUMP	An incredible guy, respected by all — Senator Lamar Alexander.
0	46.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	47.0		TRUMP	And so many more.
0	48.0		TRUMP	Thank you all for being here.
0	49.0		TRUMP	We’re going to be working closely together to deliver for you, the citizens of Tennessee, like you’ve never been delivered for before.
0	50.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	51.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	52.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	53.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	54.0		TRUMP	We’re going to reduce your taxes — big league.
0	55.0		TRUMP	Big.
0	56.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	57.0		TRUMP	Big.
0	58.0		TRUMP	I want to start that process so quickly.
0	59.0		TRUMP	Got to get the healthcare done.
0	60.0		TRUMP	We got to start the tax reductions.
0	61.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	62.0		TRUMP	We are going to enforce our trade rules and bring back our jobs, which are scattered all over the world.
0	63.0		TRUMP	They’re coming back to our country.
0	64.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	65.0		TRUMP	We’re going to support the amazing — absolutely amazing men and women of law enforcement.
0	66.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	67.0		TRUMP	Protect your freedoms, and defend the Second Amendment.
0	68.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	69.0		TRUMP	And we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag.
0	70.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	71.0		TRUMP	It’s been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and we’ve been putting our America First agenda very much into action.
0	72.0		TRUMP	You see what’s happening.
0	73.0		TRUMP	We’re keeping our promises.
0	74.0		TRUMP	"In fact, they have signs — ""He’s Kept His Promise."""
0	75.0		TRUMP	They’re all over the place.
0	76.0		TRUMP	I have.
0	77.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	78.0		TRUMP	We have done far more — I think maybe more than anybody’s done in this office in 50 days, that I could tell you.
0	79.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	80.0		TRUMP	And we have just gotten started.
0	81.0		TRUMP	Wait until you see what’s coming, folks.
0	82.0		TRUMP	We’ve appointed a Supreme Court justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia.
0	83.0		TRUMP	His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.
0	84.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	85.0		TRUMP	He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
0	86.0		TRUMP	We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy — and I mean bloated — while protecting our national security.
0	87.0		TRUMP	You see what we’re doing with our military — bigger, better, stronger than ever before.
0	88.0		TRUMP	You see what’s happening.
0	89.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	90.0		TRUMP	And you’re already seeing the results.
1	91.0		TRUMP	Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.
0	92.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	93.0		TRUMP	We believe — especially the people in Tennessee, I know you people so well —
0	94.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	95.0		TRUMP	— in peace through strength.
0	96.0		TRUMP	That’s what we’re going to have.
0	97.0		TRUMP	And we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share.
0	98.0		TRUMP	They have to pay.
0	99.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	100.0		TRUMP	We’ve begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before — slash, slash.
0	101.0		TRUMP	We’re going to protect the environment, we’re going to protect people’s safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we’re going to bring it down to where it should be.
0	102.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	103.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	104.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	105.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	106.0		TRUMP	Okay, let’s go.
0	107.0		TRUMP	One person — and they’ll be the story tomorrow — did you hear there was a protestor?
0	108.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	109.0		TRUMP	We’re going to put our miners back to work.
1	110.0		TRUMP	We’re going to put our auto industry back to work.
1	111.0		TRUMP	Already because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we haven’t seen in many, many decades.
0	112.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	113.0		TRUMP	In the first two job reports since I took the oath of office, we’ve already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, it’s just beginning.
0	114.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	115.0		TRUMP	I’ve already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.
0	116.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	117.0		TRUMP	A lot of jobs.
1	118.0		TRUMP	I’ve also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel.
0	119.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	120.0		TRUMP	They want to build them here, they use our steel.
0	121.0		TRUMP	We believe in two simple rules:  Buy American and Hire American.
0	122.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	123.0		TRUMP	On trade, I’ve kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster.
0	124.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	125.0		TRUMP	Tennessee has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever in history.
0	126.0		TRUMP	Our nation has lost over 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization — 60,000.
0	127.0		TRUMP	Think of that.
0	128.0		TRUMP	More than that.
0	129.0		TRUMP	We’re not going to let it happen anymore.
0	130.0		TRUMP	From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies.
0	131.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	132.0		TRUMP	And if America does what it says, and if your President does what I’ve been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks.
0	133.0		TRUMP	Not even close.
0	134.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	135.0		TRUMP	If a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences.
0	136.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	137.0		TRUMP	That’s what we have borders for.
0	138.0		TRUMP	And by the way, aren’t our borders getting extremely strong?
0	139.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	140.0		TRUMP	Very strong.
0	141.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	142.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	143.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	144.0		TRUMP	Don’t even think about it.
0	145.0		TRUMP	We will build the wall.
0	146.0		TRUMP	Don’t even think about it.
0	147.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	148.0		TRUMP	In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid.
0	149.0		TRUMP	We had hundreds of bidders.
0	150.0		TRUMP	Everybody wants to build our wall.
0	151.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	152.0		TRUMP	Usually, that means we’re going to get a good price.
0	153.0		TRUMP	We’re going to get a good price, believe me.
0	154.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	155.0		TRUMP	We’re going to build the wall.
0	156.0		TRUMP	Some of the fake news said, I don’t think Donald Trump wants to build the wall.
0	157.0		TRUMP	Can you imagine if I said we’re not going to build a wall?
0	158.0		TRUMP	Fake news.
0	159.0		TRUMP	Fake, fake news.
0	160.0		TRUMP	Fake news, folks.
0	161.0		TRUMP	A lot of fake.
0	162.0		TRUMP	No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are.
0	163.0		TRUMP	It’s under design, and you’re going to see some very good things happening.
0	164.0		TRUMP	But the border by itself right now is doing very well.
0	165.0		TRUMP	It’s becoming very strong.
0	166.0		TRUMP	General Kelly has done a great job — General Kelly.
0	167.0		TRUMP	My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States.
0	168.0		TRUMP	Our southern border will be protected always.
0	169.0		TRUMP	It will have the wall.
0	170.0		TRUMP	Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon.
0	171.0		TRUMP	You’re already seeing what’s going on.
0	172.0		TRUMP	The drugs are pouring into our country, folks.
0	173.0		TRUMP	They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we’re going to stop it.
0	174.0		TRUMP	We’re not going to playing games.
0	175.0		TRUMP	Not going to be playing games.
0	176.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	177.0		TRUMP	Following my executive action — and don’t forget, we’ve only been here for like — what? — 50 days — we’ve already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day — 61 percent.
0	178.0		TRUMP	Think about it.
0	179.0		TRUMP	And now people are saying, we’re not going to go there anymore because we can’t get in.
0	180.0		TRUMP	So it’s going to get better and better.
0	181.0		TRUMP	We got to stop those drugs, though.
0	182.0		TRUMP	We got to stop those drugs.
0	183.0		TRUMP	During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.
0	184.0		TRUMP	These American victims were ignored by the media.
0	185.0		TRUMP	They were ignored by Washington.
0	186.0		TRUMP	But they were not ignored by me, and they’re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.
0	187.0		TRUMP	Not going to happen.
0	188.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	189.0		TRUMP	As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens.
0	190.0		TRUMP	One by one — you’re reading about it, right?
0	191.0		TRUMP	They’re being thrown out of our country.
0	192.0		TRUMP	They’re being thrown into prisons.
0	193.0		TRUMP	And we will not let them back in.
0	194.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	195.0		TRUMP	We’re also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism.
0	196.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	197.0		TRUMP	We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino — hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.
1	198.0		TRUMP	Right now we have investigations going on all over — hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.
0	199.0		TRUMP	We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.
0	200.0		TRUMP	For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.
0	201.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	202.0		TRUMP	But let me give you the bad news.
0	203.0		TRUMP	We don’t like bad news, right?
0	204.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to hear — and I’ll turn it into good.
0	205.0		TRUMP	But let me give you the bad, the sad news.
0	206.0		TRUMP	Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii — part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court — and I have to be nice; otherwise I’ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.
0	207.0		TRUMP	I’ll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world — I will be criticized — I’ll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.
0	208.0		TRUMP	I would never want to do that.
0	209.0		TRUMP	A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
0	210.0		AUDIENCE	Booo —
0	211.0		TRUMP	The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.
0	212.0		TRUMP	This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit’s — in my opinion — flawed ruling.
0	213.0		TRUMP	This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.
0	214.0		TRUMP	The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems — or she — or she.
0	215.0		TRUMP	Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.
0	216.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	217.0		TRUMP	When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.
0	218.0		TRUMP	So we have a lot of lawyers here.
0	219.0		TRUMP	We also have a lot of smart people here.
0	220.0		TRUMP	Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration — and you know what I’m talking about, right?
0	221.0		TRUMP	Can I read this to you?
0	222.0		TRUMP	Listen to this.
0	223.0		TRUMP	Now, we’re all smart people.
0	224.0		TRUMP	We’re all good students — some are bad students, but even if you’re a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.
0	225.0		TRUMP	Ready?
0	226.0		TRUMP	So here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it.
0	227.0		TRUMP	And it was put here for the security of our country.
0	228.0		TRUMP	And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.
0	229.0		TRUMP	And sometimes we need it very badly for security — security of our country.
0	230.0		TRUMP	It says — now, listen how easy this is.
0	231.0		TRUMP	Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he — see, it wasn’t politically correct, because it should say he or she.
0	232.0		TRUMP	You know, today they’d say that.
0	233.0		TRUMP	Actually, that’s the only mistake they made.
0	234.0		TRUMP	as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate.
0	235.0		TRUMP	In other words, if he thinks there’s danger out there, he or she — whoever is President — can say, I’m sorry, folks, not now, please.
0	236.0		TRUMP	We’ve got enough problems.
0	237.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	238.0		TRUMP	We’re talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people.
0	239.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	240.0		TRUMP	Now, I know you people aren’t skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee.
0	241.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	242.0		TRUMP	Nobody — not Tennessee.
0	243.0		TRUMP	You don’t think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?
0	244.0		TRUMP	No.
0	245.0		AUDIENCE	Booo —
0	246.0		TRUMP	THE PRESIDENT:
0	247.0		TRUMP	This ruling makes us look weak — which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.
0	248.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	249.0		TRUMP	Just look at our borders.
0	250.0		TRUMP	We’re going to fight this terrible ruling.
0	251.0		TRUMP	We’re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.
0	252.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	253.0		TRUMP	We’re going to win.
0	254.0		TRUMP	We’re going to keep our citizens safe.
0	255.0		TRUMP	And regardless, we’re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.
0	256.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	257.0		TRUMP	Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz —- good lawyer — just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.
0	258.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	259.0		TRUMP	Remember this, I wasn’t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let’s tailor it.
0	260.0		TRUMP	This is a watered–down version of the first one.
0	261.0		TRUMP	This is a watered–down version.
0	262.0		TRUMP	And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one.
0	263.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	264.0		TRUMP	The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.
0	265.0		TRUMP	I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.
0	266.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	267.0		TRUMP	And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me.
0	268.0		TRUMP	Not today, not ever.
0	269.0		TRUMP	We’re going to win it.
0	270.0		TRUMP	We’re going to win it.
0	271.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	272.0		TRUMP	We’re going to apply common sense.
0	273.0		TRUMP	We’re going to apply intelligence.
0	274.0		TRUMP	And we’re never quitting, and we’re never going away, and we’re never, ever giving up.
0	275.0		TRUMP	The best way to keep foreign terrorists — or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists — from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.
0	276.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	277.0		TRUMP	We’ll take it, but these are the problems we have.
0	278.0		TRUMP	People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit.
0	279.0		TRUMP	And I’ll tell you what, that 9th Circuit — you have to see.
0	280.0		TRUMP	Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.
0	281.0		TRUMP	Take a look.
0	282.0		TRUMP	And this is what we have to live with.
0	283.0		TRUMP	Finally, I want to get to taxes.
0	284.0		TRUMP	I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but —
0	285.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	286.0		TRUMP	— but before I can do that — I would have loved to have put it first, I’ll be honest — there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.
0	287.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	288.0		TRUMP	If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you’re down to practically no insurers.
0	289.0		TRUMP	You’re going to have nobody.
0	290.0		TRUMP	You’re going to have nobody.
0	291.0		TRUMP	And this is true all over.
0	292.0		TRUMP	The insurers are fleeing.
0	293.0		TRUMP	The insurers are fleeing.
0	294.0		TRUMP	It’s a catastrophic situation, and there’s nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won’t be around for a year or two.
0	295.0		TRUMP	It’s gone.
0	296.0		TRUMP	So it’s not like, oh, gee, they have this.
0	297.0		TRUMP	Obamacare is gone.
0	298.0		TRUMP	Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.
0	299.0		TRUMP	It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.
0	300.0		TRUMP	Remember all of the broken promises?
0	301.0		TRUMP	You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
0	302.0		TRUMP	Remember the wise guy — remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people — the so–called architect — the American people are stupid because they approved it?
0	303.0		TRUMP	We’re going to show them.
0	304.0		TRUMP	Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.
0	305.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	306.0		TRUMP	And remember this — remember this:  If we took, because there’s such divisiveness — and I’m not just talking now, with me.
0	307.0		TRUMP	There was with Obama.
0	308.0		TRUMP	There was with Bush.
0	309.0		TRUMP	The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.
0	310.0		TRUMP	I remember years ago, I’d go to Washington — I was always very politically active — and Republicans and Democrats, they’d fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.
0	311.0		TRUMP	Today, there’s a level that nobody has seen before.
0	312.0		TRUMP	Just remember this:  If we submitted the Democrats’ plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn’t get one vote from the Democrats.
0	313.0		TRUMP	That’s the way it is.
0	314.0		TRUMP	That’s how much divisiveness and other things there are.
0	315.0		TRUMP	So it’s a problem.
0	316.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to get it by.
0	317.0		TRUMP	So, I’ve met with so many victims of Obamacare —- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.
0	318.0		TRUMP	At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw — the government forcing people to buy a government–approved product.
0	319.0		TRUMP	There are very few people — very few people.
0	320.0		AUDIENCE	Booo —
0	321.0		TRUMP	By the way — watch what happens.
0	322.0		TRUMP	Now you just booed Obamacare.
0	323.0		TRUMP	They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned — they’re bad people, folks.
0	324.0		TRUMP	They’re bad people.
0	325.0		AUDIENCE	Booo —
0	326.0		TRUMP	Tonight, I’ll go home, I’ll turn on, I’ll say — listen, I’ll turn on that television.
0	327.0		TRUMP	My wife will say, darling, it’s too bad you got booed.
0	328.0		TRUMP	I said, I didn’t get booed.
0	329.0		TRUMP	This was a — I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare.
0	330.0		TRUMP	Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.
0	331.0		TRUMP	But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.
0	332.0		TRUMP	So we’ll see.
0	333.0		TRUMP	It’s the fake, fake media.
0	334.0		TRUMP	We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.
0	335.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	336.0		TRUMP	The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to all get together and we’re going to get something done.
0	337.0		TRUMP	Remember this — if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.
0	338.0		TRUMP	They won’t vote, no matter what we do, they’re not going to vote.
0	339.0		TRUMP	So we’re doing it a different way, a complex way.
0	340.0		TRUMP	It’s fine.
0	341.0		TRUMP	The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three — it’s going to be great.
0	342.0		TRUMP	It’s going to be great.
0	343.0		TRUMP	And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like.
0	344.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	345.0		TRUMP	The House legislation does so much for you.
0	346.0		TRUMP	It gives the states Medicaid flexibility.
0	347.0		TRUMP	And some of the states will take over their healthcare.
0	348.0		TRUMP	Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money — they run a great plan.
0	349.0		TRUMP	We have states that are doing great.
0	350.0		TRUMP	It gives great flexibility.
0	351.0		TRUMP	Thank you, folks.
0	352.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	353.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	354.0		TRUMP	It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.
0	355.0		TRUMP	It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs.
0	356.0		TRUMP	The bill that I will ultimately sign — and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we’re going to get it done — we’ll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family.
0	357.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	358.0		TRUMP	And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three — I’m going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.
0	359.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	360.0		TRUMP	We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we’re going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day — unlike the way Obamacare was passed.
0	361.0		TRUMP	Remember, folks, if we don’t do anything, Obamacare is gone.
0	362.0		TRUMP	It’s not like, oh, gee, it’s going to be wonderful in three years.
0	363.0		TRUMP	It’s gone.
0	364.0		TRUMP	It’s gone.
0	365.0		TRUMP	It’s gone.
0	366.0		TRUMP	Not working.
0	367.0		TRUMP	It’s gone.
0	368.0		TRUMP	What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don’t believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions.
0	369.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	370.0		TRUMP	I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country — not just on healthcare, but all across our government.
0	371.0		TRUMP	We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine.
0	372.0		TRUMP	We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values.
0	373.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	374.0		TRUMP	We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we’re going to lower taxes.
0	375.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	376.0		TRUMP	And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing.
0	377.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	378.0		TRUMP	No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home.
0	379.0		TRUMP	We all salute the same flag.
0	380.0		TRUMP	And we all are made by the same God.
0	381.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	382.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	383.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	384.0		AUDIENCE	USA!
0	385.0		TRUMP	It’s time to embrace our glorious American destiny.
0	386.0		TRUMP	Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country.
0	387.0		TRUMP	All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.
0	388.0		TRUMP	And we found that out very recently in our last election — a lot of pride.
0	389.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	390.0		TRUMP	We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us.
0	391.0		TRUMP	The future belongs to all of you.
0	392.0		TRUMP	This is your moment.
0	393.0		TRUMP	This is your time.
0	394.0		TRUMP	This is the hour when history is made.
0	395.0		TRUMP	All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again.
0	396.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	397.0		TRUMP	We will make America wealthy again.
0	398.0		TRUMP	We will make America proud again.
0	399.0		TRUMP	We will make America safe again.
0	400.0		TRUMP	And we will make America great again.
0	401.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	402.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	403.0		TRUMP	God bless you.
0	404.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	405.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	406.0		TRUMP	God bless you, everybody.
0	407.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	2.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	3.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	4.0		TRUMP	I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
0	5.0		TRUMP	We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.
0	6.0		TRUMP	But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.
0	7.0		TRUMP	Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.
1	8.0		TRUMP	Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.
1	9.0		TRUMP	The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.
1	10.0		TRUMP	We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.
1	11.0		TRUMP	I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
0	12.0		TRUMP	It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.
0	13.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	14.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	15.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	16.0		TRUMP	In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.
0	17.0		TRUMP	We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
0	18.0		TRUMP	Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.
0	19.0		TRUMP	Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution.
0	20.0		TRUMP	One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
0	21.0		TRUMP	And believe me, we’ve just begun.
0	22.0		TRUMP	The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.
0	23.0		TRUMP	On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments.
0	24.0		TRUMP	And I don’t want anything to get in our way.
0	25.0		TRUMP	I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.
0	26.0		TRUMP	Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord —
0	27.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	28.0		TRUMP	— thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
0	29.0		TRUMP	So we’re getting out.
0	30.0		TRUMP	But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.
0	31.0		TRUMP	And if we can, that’s great.
0	32.0		TRUMP	And if we can’t, that’s fine.
0	33.0		TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)
0	34.0		TRUMP	As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.
1	35.0		TRUMP	The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.
1	36.0		TRUMP	Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
0	37.0		TRUMP	This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.
1	38.0		TRUMP	Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.
1	39.0		TRUMP	This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.
0	40.0		TRUMP	They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.
1	41.0		TRUMP	According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.
1	42.0		TRUMP	The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.
0	43.0		TRUMP	Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
1	44.0		TRUMP	As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.
1	45.0		TRUMP	For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.
0	46.0		TRUMP	They can do whatever they want for 13 years.
0	47.0		TRUMP	Not us.
0	48.0		TRUMP	India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
0	49.0		TRUMP	There are many other examples.
0	50.0		TRUMP	But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.
1	51.0		TRUMP	Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
0	52.0		TRUMP	We’re having a big opening in two weeks.
0	53.0		TRUMP	Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.
0	54.0		TRUMP	A big opening of a brand-new mine.
0	55.0		TRUMP	It’s unheard of.
0	56.0		TRUMP	For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.
0	57.0		TRUMP	They asked me if I’d go.
0	58.0		TRUMP	I’m going to try.
1	59.0		TRUMP	China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
1	60.0		TRUMP	So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.
0	61.0		TRUMP	India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.
0	62.0		TRUMP	Think of it:  India can double their coal production.
0	63.0		TRUMP	We’re supposed to get rid of ours.
0	64.0		TRUMP	Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
0	65.0		TRUMP	In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
0	66.0		TRUMP	This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.
0	67.0		TRUMP	The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.
0	68.0		TRUMP	A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
0	69.0		TRUMP	We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.
0	70.0		TRUMP	We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
0	71.0		TRUMP	Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
0	72.0		TRUMP	The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
0	73.0		TRUMP	At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country —
0	74.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	75.0		TRUMP	— will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.
0	76.0		TRUMP	Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.
0	77.0		TRUMP	Tiny, tiny amount.
0	78.0		TRUMP	In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.
0	79.0		TRUMP	"As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  ""The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate."""
0	80.0		TRUMP	The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
0	81.0		TRUMP	We’ll be the cleanest.
0	82.0		TRUMP	We’re going to have the cleanest air.
0	83.0		TRUMP	We’re going to have the cleanest water.
0	84.0		TRUMP	We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.
0	85.0		TRUMP	We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.
0	86.0		TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)
0	87.0		TRUMP	And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.
0	88.0		TRUMP	One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
0	89.0		TRUMP	I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.
0	90.0		TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)
0	91.0		TRUMP	So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
0	92.0		TRUMP	We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.
0	93.0		TRUMP	And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.
0	94.0		TRUMP	And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.
0	95.0		TRUMP	And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.
0	96.0		TRUMP	But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement.
0	97.0		TRUMP	I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.
0	98.0		TRUMP	No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
0	99.0		TRUMP	The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.
0	100.0		TRUMP	That’s not going to happen while I’m President.
0	101.0		TRUMP	I’m sorry.
0	102.0		TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)
0	103.0		TRUMP	My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.
0	104.0		TRUMP	Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well.
0	105.0		TRUMP	I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
0	106.0		TRUMP	The Republicans are working very, very hard.
0	107.0		TRUMP	We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.
0	108.0		TRUMP	But it’s going very well.
0	109.0		TRUMP	The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.
0	110.0		TRUMP	They don’t put America first.
0	111.0		TRUMP	I do, and I always will.
0	112.0		TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)
0	113.0		TRUMP	The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.
0	114.0		TRUMP	You see what’s happening.
0	115.0		TRUMP	It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.
0	116.0		TRUMP	At what point does America get demeaned?
0	117.0		TRUMP	At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?
0	118.0		TRUMP	We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.
0	119.0		TRUMP	We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.
0	120.0		TRUMP	And they won’t be.
0	121.0		TRUMP	They won’t be.
0	122.0		TRUMP	I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
0	123.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	124.0		TRUMP	I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.
0	125.0		TRUMP	Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.
0	126.0		TRUMP	Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
0	127.0		TRUMP	The process has begun from day one.
0	128.0		TRUMP	But now we’re down to business.
0	129.0		TRUMP	Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.
0	130.0		TRUMP	So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
0	131.0		TRUMP	Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.
0	132.0		TRUMP	The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.
0	133.0		TRUMP	That’s where they came.
0	134.0		TRUMP	Believe me, they didn’t come from me.
0	135.0		TRUMP	They came just before I came into office.
0	136.0		TRUMP	Not good.
0	137.0		TRUMP	And not good the way they took the money.
0	138.0		TRUMP	"In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as ""peanuts,"" and stated that ""the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog."""
0	139.0		TRUMP	In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.
1	140.0		TRUMP	And nobody even knows where the money is going to.
1	141.0		TRUMP	Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?
0	142.0		TRUMP	Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
0	143.0		TRUMP	America is $20 trillion in debt.
0	144.0		TRUMP	Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.
0	145.0		TRUMP	Millions of our citizens are out of work.
0	146.0		TRUMP	And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
0	147.0		TRUMP	So think of that.
0	148.0		TRUMP	There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.
0	149.0		TRUMP	Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.
0	150.0		TRUMP	Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.
0	151.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	152.0		TRUMP	Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
0	153.0		TRUMP	And I will.
0	154.0		TRUMP	Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.
0	155.0		TRUMP	It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.
0	156.0		TRUMP	The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.
0	157.0		TRUMP	In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point.
1	158.0		TRUMP	And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.
1	159.0		TRUMP	Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
0	160.0		TRUMP	As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.
0	161.0		TRUMP	The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.
0	162.0		TRUMP	It is time to exit the Paris Accord —
0	163.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	164.0		TRUMP	— and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
0	165.0		TRUMP	It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France.
0	166.0		TRUMP	It is time to make America great again.
0	167.0		TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)
0	168.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	169.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	170.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	171.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	172.0		TRUMP	Very important.
0	173.0		TRUMP	I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	2.0		TRUMP	You just want massive tax cuts.
0	3.0		TRUMP	That’s what you want.
0	4.0		TRUMP	That’s the only reason you’re going so wild.
0	5.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	6.0		TRUMP	But it’s wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana.
0	7.0		TRUMP	What a place.
0	8.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	9.0		TRUMP	I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today.
0	10.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	11.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much for being here.
0	12.0		TRUMP	Appreciate it.
0	13.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	14.0		TRUMP	I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well.
0	15.0		TRUMP	We appreciate it.
0	16.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	17.0		TRUMP	Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane.
0	18.0		TRUMP	I mean, their island was virtually destroyed.
0	19.0		TRUMP	Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.
0	20.0		TRUMP	Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly.
0	21.0		TRUMP	I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms.
0	22.0		TRUMP	We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done.
0	23.0		TRUMP	It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico.
0	24.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	25.0		TRUMP	And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis.
0	26.0		TRUMP	It’s something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that.
0	27.0		TRUMP	And I’m very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected.
0	28.0		TRUMP	And many of their policemen — in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it’s been a tough go.
0	29.0		TRUMP	But we are — we’re going to get it back.
0	30.0		TRUMP	Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county’s history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare.
1	31.0		TRUMP	We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy.
0	32.0		TRUMP	But with the rules of reconciliation, we’re up against a deadline of Friday — two days.
0	33.0		TRUMP	That’s just two days.
0	34.0		TRUMP	And yes-vote senator — we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator — who is a yes vote, but he’s home recovering from a pretty tough situation.
0	35.0		TRUMP	And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent.
0	36.0		TRUMP	It’s going to be better managed for the people that it serves.
0	37.0		TRUMP	Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C.
0	38.0		TRUMP	Not even a contest.
0	39.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	40.0		TRUMP	And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly.
0	41.0		TRUMP	But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote.
0	42.0		TRUMP	So we’re getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare.
0	43.0		TRUMP	And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I’d come in and sign.
0	44.0		TRUMP	But it didn’t work that way.
0	45.0		TRUMP	There were a couple of people that — I won’t say anything.
0	46.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	47.0		TRUMP	But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we’re going to have a vote.
0	48.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to be able to get that through, and I think we’ll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier.
0	49.0		TRUMP	But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve.
0	50.0		TRUMP	By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won’t for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one.
0	51.0		TRUMP	And most of you know exactly what I’m talking about.
0	52.0		TRUMP	We’re here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People.
0	53.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	54.0		TRUMP	This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it’s probably something I can say that I’m very good at.
0	55.0		TRUMP	I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.
0	56.0		TRUMP	We’re going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country — and most people thought left our country for good.
0	57.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	58.0		TRUMP	We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American.
0	59.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	60.0		TRUMP	It’s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers.
0	61.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	62.0		TRUMP	Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens.
0	63.0		TRUMP	This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation — and are we cutting regulation?
0	64.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	65.0		TRUMP	And businesses all across the country have taken notice.
1	66.0		TRUMP	In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states.
1	67.0		TRUMP	Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed — meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.
0	68.0		TRUMP	All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again.
0	69.0		TRUMP	They chose, and their choice was so important.
0	70.0		TRUMP	It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of
0	71.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	72.0		TRUMP	— who signed the largest income tax cut in the state’s history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence.
0	73.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	74.0		TRUMP	It’s time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana.
0	75.0		TRUMP	We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.
0	76.0		TRUMP	That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office.
0	77.0		TRUMP	That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.
0	78.0		TRUMP	Already, we’re seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first.
0	79.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	80.0		TRUMP	Unemployment is at a 16-year low.
1	81.0		TRUMP	Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium.
0	82.0		TRUMP	It’s really a fantastic thing to see.
0	83.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	84.0		TRUMP	Wages are rising.
0	85.0		TRUMP	Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs.
1	86.0		TRUMP	GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time.
0	87.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	88.0		TRUMP	And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact.
0	89.0		TRUMP	But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better.
0	90.0		TRUMP	Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country.
0	91.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	92.0		TRUMP	America is back on the right track.
0	93.0		TRUMP	And I see so many red hats — Make America Great Again.
0	94.0		TRUMP	That’s what we’re doing — Make America Great Again.
0	95.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	96.0		TRUMP	But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America’s outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code.
0	97.0		TRUMP	It’s a relic.
0	98.0		TRUMP	We’ve got to change it.
0	99.0		TRUMP	We have to compete — compete with other countries.
0	100.0		TRUMP	The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America’s economic comeback because it can be far greater than it’s ever been.
0	101.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally — and want and deserve.
0	102.0		TRUMP	For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform.
0	103.0		TRUMP	Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families — for the working man and woman — and for businesses of all sizes.
0	104.0		TRUMP	I look forward
0	105.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	106.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	107.0		TRUMP	I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people.
0	108.0		TRUMP	These tax cuts are significant.
0	109.0		TRUMP	There’s never been tax cuts like what we’re talking about.
0	110.0		TRUMP	Our framework is based on four key ideas:
0	111.0		TRUMP	First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans — the people that work so long, so hard, and they’ve been forgotten.
0	112.0		TRUMP	But they’re not forgotten anymore.
0	113.0		TRUMP	I think we proved that on November 8th.
0	114.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	115.0		TRUMP	Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free,
0	116.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	117.0		TRUMP	- and a married couple won’t pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income.
0	118.0		TRUMP	So, a married couple — up to $24,000 — can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do.
0	119.0		TRUMP	So much better.
0	120.0		TRUMP	In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero.
0	121.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	122.0		TRUMP	At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent.
0	123.0		TRUMP	Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today.
0	124.0		TRUMP	Where are they?
0	125.0		TRUMP	Oh, hello, Jonathan.
0	126.0		TRUMP	How are you?
0	127.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	128.0		TRUMP	Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company.
0	129.0		TRUMP	Together they’re raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000.
0	130.0		TRUMP	Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more.
0	131.0		TRUMP	And that’s just on federal taxes.
0	132.0		TRUMP	So they would have saved at least $1,000.
0	133.0		TRUMP	Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for.
0	134.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	135.0		TRUMP	We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families.
0	136.0		TRUMP	Greatly expanded.
0	137.0		TRUMP	We’re also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children.
0	138.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	139.0		TRUMP	And this is just one more critical way that we’re targeting relief to working families.
0	140.0		TRUMP	In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved — and we love these people, but we’re caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents — will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit.
0	141.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	142.0		TRUMP	We’re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family.
0	143.0		TRUMP	By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners.
0	144.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1	145.0		TRUMP	Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected.
0	146.0		TRUMP	They can call me all they want.
0	147.0		TRUMP	It’s not going to help.
1	148.0		TRUMP	I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me.
0	149.0		TRUMP	Believe me.
0	150.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	151.0		TRUMP	But what is good for me — not only as President and legacy — what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years.
0	152.0		TRUMP	That’s good for me.
0	153.0		TRUMP	That’s good for everyone.
0	154.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	155.0		TRUMP	And that’s what I think is going to happen.
0	156.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	157.0		TRUMP	And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me.
0	158.0		TRUMP	In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers.
0	159.0		TRUMP	We’ve also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people.
0	160.0		TRUMP	Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally.
0	161.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	162.0		TRUMP	Americans waste money.
0	163.0		TRUMP	Americans waste so much money — billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code.
1	164.0		TRUMP	More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes.
0	165.0		TRUMP	Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper.
0	166.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	167.0		TRUMP	We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT.
0	168.0		TRUMP	About time.
0	169.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	170.0		TRUMP	The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts.
0	171.0		TRUMP	You’re all familiar with it.
0	172.0		TRUMP	Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with.
0	173.0		TRUMP	We are making our taxes simple again.
0	174.0		TRUMP	We are simplifying our tax system.
1	175.0		TRUMP	To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax.
0	176.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	177.0		TRUMP	That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax — lose the business, ends up going out of business.
0	178.0		TRUMP	All of those jobs are lost.
1	179.0		TRUMP	The farmers in particular are affected.
1	180.0		TRUMP	They have wonderful farms, but they can’t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm.
0	181.0		TRUMP	The people that buy it don’t run it with love.
0	182.0		TRUMP	They can’t run it the same way, and it goes out.
1	183.0		TRUMP	So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers.
0	184.0		TRUMP	And we’re getting rid of it.
0	185.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	186.0		TRUMP	Now if you don’t like your family, it won’t matter, okay?
0	187.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	188.0		TRUMP	But for those that love your family, it matters a lot.
0	189.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	190.0		TRUMP	With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg — Where’s Kip?
0	191.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, Kip.
0	192.0		TRUMP	Hi, Kip
0	193.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	194.0		TRUMP	 who fears that his family’s farming heritage — it’s been a long time.
0	195.0		TRUMP	How long, Kip?
0	196.0		TRUMP	A hundred and eighty-seven years — that’s peanuts, Kip.
0	197.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	198.0		TRUMP	Wow.
0	199.0		TRUMP	That’s a long time.
1	200.0		TRUMP	But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family.
0	201.0		TRUMP	We’re not going to let that happen.
0	202.0		TRUMP	We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today.
0	203.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	204.0		TRUMP	We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans.
0	205.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	206.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	207.0		TRUMP	Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.
0	208.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	209.0		TRUMP	In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers.
0	210.0		TRUMP	Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations.
0	211.0		TRUMP	And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways.
0	212.0		TRUMP	They say they’re friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals.
0	213.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	214.0		TRUMP	And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines — Dakota Access.
0	215.0		TRUMP	You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved.
0	216.0		TRUMP	So we’re letting that happen.
0	217.0		TRUMP	But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more.
0	218.0		TRUMP	And it was a beautiful sight to behold.
0	219.0		TRUMP	Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did.
0	220.0		TRUMP	And I shouldn’t say even better because we didn’t run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out.
0	221.0		TRUMP	And we’re stopping that, and you see it right here what we’ve done.
1	222.0		TRUMP	Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world.
0	223.0		TRUMP	That’s not good.
0	224.0		TRUMP	We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we’re not surrendering anymore.
0	225.0		TRUMP	We’re not surrendering anymore.
0	226.0		TRUMP	Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again.
0	227.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	228.0		TRUMP	We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent.
0	229.0		TRUMP	That’s way down from 35 and 39
0	230.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	231.0		TRUMP	which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations.
0	232.0		TRUMP	This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven’t seen in many years.
0	233.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	234.0		TRUMP	When our companies move to other countries, it’s our loyal American workers who get hurt.
0	235.0		TRUMP	And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it’s our wonderful workers who reap the rewards.
0	236.0		TRUMP	And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they’re going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States — between increasing and new — five.
0	237.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	238.0		TRUMP	You’ll be hearing about that very soon.
0	239.0		TRUMP	And I said thank you very much, and he said, “you know what?
0	240.0		TRUMP	It’s starting to happen in the United States.
0	241.0		TRUMP	It’s starting to happen.”
0	242.0		TRUMP	So I just wanted to let you know that.
0	243.0		TRUMP	I promised I wouldn’t say who.
0	244.0		TRUMP	I’ll keep my word.
0	245.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	246.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	247.0		TRUMP	Unless you force me.
0	248.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	249.0		AUDIENCE MEMBERS	Who?
0	250.0		TRUMP	Members of both parties — it happens to be in the automobile industry.
0	251.0		TRUMP	That’s a good industry.
0	252.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	253.0		TRUMP	Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country.
0	254.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	255.0		TRUMP	And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent — much lower.
0	256.0		TRUMP	Big difference.
0	257.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	258.0		TRUMP	This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years.
0	259.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	260.0		TRUMP	To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off — listen to this — the cost of equipment in the year they buy it.
0	261.0		TRUMP	That is big.
0	262.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	263.0		TRUMP	And that’s instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time.
0	264.0		TRUMP	Now that’s called incentive.
0	265.0		TRUMP	That’s called incentive.
0	266.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	267.0		TRUMP	This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong.
0	268.0		TRUMP	Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis.
0	269.0		TRUMP	John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary.
0	270.0		TRUMP	Congratulations, John.
0	271.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	272.0		TRUMP	And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I’m just thinking — I have to mention this — you know, we have a fence around the White House.
0	273.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	274.0		TRUMP	We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence.
0	275.0		TRUMP	And I figured, you know — I’m pretty good at construction — I figured, I don’t know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half.
0	276.0		TRUMP	And this has been taking place over a long period of time — previous administrations.
0	277.0		TRUMP	So I said, “how much is the fence you’re talking around the White House?”
0	278.0		TRUMP	“Sir, the fence will cost approximately $50 million.”
0	279.0		TRUMP	I said, “What?”
0	280.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	281.0		TRUMP	I kid you not, and we have thousands of things like that.
0	282.0		TRUMP	Thousands.
0	283.0		TRUMP	We’re going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million.
0	284.0		TRUMP	Now, I assume it’s a strong fence.
0	285.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	286.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	287.0		TRUMP	So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million?
0	288.0		TRUMP	I think he could take $49 off right now and he’d have plenty of profit.
0	289.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	290.0		TRUMP	Right, John?
0	291.0		TRUMP	It’s crazy.
0	292.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	293.0		TRUMP	It’s crazy.
0	294.0		TRUMP	Never understand it, but we’re working on it.
0	295.0		TRUMP	John says that a tax cut like we’re proposing will make his business more competitive, allowing him to expand, hire more workers, and raise wages for his current employees.
0	296.0		TRUMP	Right, John?
0	297.0		TRUMP	Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology.
0	298.0		TRUMP	Where’s Aaron?
0	299.0		TRUMP	Hello, Aaron.
0	300.0		TRUMP	Hi.
0	301.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	302.0		TRUMP	It’s a good field.
0	303.0		TRUMP	Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high — and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas.
0	304.0		TRUMP	You’ve been watching it, Aaron.
0	305.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	306.0		TRUMP	All over.
0	307.0		TRUMP	Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States.
0	308.0		TRUMP	We’re going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America.
0	309.0		TRUMP	You’re going to be in a much different position.
0	310.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	311.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	312.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	313.0		TRUMP	Tremendous incentives.
0	314.0		TRUMP	We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA.
0	315.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	316.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	317.0		TRUMP	Made in the USA.
0	318.0		TRUMP	Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
0	319.0		TRUMP	Our current tax system
0	320.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	321.0		TRUMP	— trillions.
0	322.0		TRUMP	And by the way, for years I’ve been hearing it’s 2.5 trillion.
0	323.0		TRUMP	So I’ve been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it’s much more.
0	324.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	325.0		TRUMP	But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it.
0	326.0		TRUMP	For years — who doesn’t want to do it?
0	327.0		TRUMP	They want to bring — but they can’t do it because it’s so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous.
0	328.0		TRUMP	So they can’t do it.
0	329.0		TRUMP	So the money stays in other countries, and it’s invested in other countries.
0	330.0		TRUMP	We want to bring it back.
0	331.0		TRUMP	But think of it, it’s one of the few things — Democrats want it and Republicans want it.
0	332.0		TRUMP	So they both want it, and yet for years they haven’t been able to do it.
0	333.0		TRUMP	Now we’re doing it.
0	334.0		TRUMP	We’re doing things.
0	335.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	336.0		TRUMP	You know, it’s one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there’s a dispute.
0	337.0		TRUMP	But here’s something everybody wants and they can’t do it.
0	338.0		TRUMP	So you can tell you, there’s a broken system in D.C., but we’re getting it fixed rather — I think — rather rapidly.
0	339.0		TRUMP	You’ll be seeing that over the next few months.
0	340.0		TRUMP	Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country.
0	341.0		TRUMP	We’re punishing them for bringing the money back in.
0	342.0		TRUMP	As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether.
0	343.0		TRUMP	And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas — so much, it’s an incredible amount — that they move the company to get their money.
0	344.0		TRUMP	We’re going to let them bring the money back home.
0	345.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	346.0		TRUMP	Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States.
0	347.0		TRUMP	We’re punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States.
0	348.0		TRUMP	We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work.
0	349.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	350.0		TRUMP	The framework I’ve just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America’s competitive edge.
0	351.0		TRUMP	Finally.
0	352.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	353.0		TRUMP	And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews.
0	354.0		TRUMP	And if Senator Donnelly doesn’t approve it, because you know he’s on the other side, we will come here.
0	355.0		TRUMP	We will campaign against him like you wouldn’t believe.
0	356.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	357.0		TRUMP	I think they’re going to approve it.
0	358.0		TRUMP	I think we’ll have — actually, I think we’ll have numerous Democrats come across because it’s the right thing to do.
0	359.0		TRUMP	These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates.
0	360.0		TRUMP	It’s what we can’t do.
0	361.0		TRUMP	Our competitors have much lower tax rates.
0	362.0		TRUMP	But no longer.
0	363.0		TRUMP	My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model.
0	364.0		TRUMP	It’s called — the American model.
0	365.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	366.0		TRUMP	Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country.
0	367.0		TRUMP	That’s what we want.
0	368.0		TRUMP	We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana.
0	369.0		TRUMP	Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they’re incentivized to leave.
0	370.0		TRUMP	But now they’re going to be incentivized to stay.
0	371.0		TRUMP	And if that doesn’t work, then we’ll get even tougher than that.
0	372.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	373.0		TRUMP	We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns.
0	374.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	375.0		TRUMP	That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family.
0	376.0		TRUMP	We want it to happen here.
0	377.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	378.0		TRUMP	Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today.
0	379.0		TRUMP	I really believe we’re going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it’s the right thing to do.
0	380.0		TRUMP	I believe that it’s the right thing to do, and I know many of them.
0	381.0		TRUMP	And they’re telling me it is the right thing to do.
0	382.0		TRUMP	President Reagan’s tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker — Tip O’Neill.
0	383.0		TRUMP	Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment.
0	384.0		TRUMP	As President Kennedy very wisely said, “The single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time” — at the right time, this is the right time — “is the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward.”
0	385.0		TRUMP	That was President Kennedy.
0	386.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	387.0		TRUMP	My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time.
0	388.0		TRUMP	Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle — it’s called a middle-class miracle, once again.
0	389.0		TRUMP	It’s also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person.
0	390.0		TRUMP	I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country.
0	391.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	392.0		TRUMP	But they’ll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard.
0	393.0		TRUMP	Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first.
0	394.0		TRUMP	And that’s what we’re doing.
0	395.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	396.0		TRUMP	History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people.
0	397.0		TRUMP	That is why today I am asking all Americans — Republican, Democrat, independent — to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again.
0	398.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	399.0		TRUMP	Call your congressmen.
0	400.0		TRUMP	Call your senators.
0	401.0		TRUMP	Let them know you’re watching.
0	402.0		TRUMP	Let them know you’re waiting.
0	403.0		TRUMP	Tell them that today is the day for decision.
0	404.0		TRUMP	That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound.
0	405.0		TRUMP	And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us.
0	406.0		TRUMP	If you demand it, the politicians will listen.
0	407.0		TRUMP	They will answer, and they will act.
0	408.0		TRUMP	And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride.
0	409.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	410.0		TRUMP	With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams.
0	411.0		TRUMP	Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
0	412.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1.0		TRUMP	Welcome to all of you deplorables.
0	2.0		TRUMP	Thank you, ma’am.
0	3.0		TRUMP	Boy, oh boy.
0	4.0		TRUMP	We’re going to have a good time tonight.
0	5.0		TRUMP	We’re going to have a good time.
0	6.0		TRUMP	Wow.
0	7.0		TRUMP	I love that.
0	8.0		TRUMP	I love that.
0	9.0		TRUMP	Look at this.
0	10.0		TRUMP	Look what that says.
0	11.0		TRUMP	Hold up that sign for the cameras.
0	12.0		TRUMP	Wow.
0	13.0		TRUMP	That’s so beautiful.
0	14.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	15.0		TRUMP	Great.
0	16.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	17.0		TRUMP	That is so nice.
0	18.0		TRUMP	And we are doing well in every way.
0	19.0		TRUMP	The polls have been incredible.
0	20.0		TRUMP	But we’re doing great.
0	21.0		TRUMP	It’s great to be in my second home — Florida.
0	22.0		TRUMP	And in the city of Miami, where I have so many wonderful friends and projects and employees.
0	23.0		TRUMP	We have an amazing group.
0	24.0		TRUMP	And all of you know Trump National Doral and we’ll go there.
0	25.0		TRUMP	Let’s go and have some fun.
0	26.0		TRUMP	We have tremendous developments in Miami on the water and Doral in particular has been a tremendous, tremendous thing.
0	27.0		TRUMP	So I really appreciate it.
0	28.0		TRUMP	I love this city.
0	29.0		TRUMP	I love the whole state.
0	30.0		TRUMP	So, and I have a lot of employees.
0	31.0		TRUMP	And I’m paying them a lot of money.
0	32.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees.
0	33.0		TRUMP	A lot.
0	34.0		TRUMP	And they’re very happy.
0	35.0		TRUMP	They like Donald Trump.
0	36.0		TRUMP	So new polls have just come in.
0	37.0		TRUMP	And we’re leading in many of the battleground states all over the country.
0	38.0		TRUMP	Including being 4 points up in a certain state known as Florida.
1	39.0		TRUMP	And the Los Angeles Times has us 6 points up nationwide.
0	40.0		TRUMP	Good poll.
0	41.0		TRUMP	If it weren’t, I wouldn’t be telling you about it, I promise.
0	42.0		TRUMP	But come Nov. 8, we’re going to win Florida, and we’re going to win the White House, and we’re going to make America great again.
0	43.0		TRUMP	It’s going to be a victory for the people.
0	44.0		TRUMP	It’s going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the veterans.
0	45.0		TRUMP	The veterans — we love our veterans.
0	46.0		TRUMP	And every citizen of this country.
0	47.0		TRUMP	It’s going to be a victory for those who haven’t had reason to hope for a very long time.
0	48.0		TRUMP	I’m campaigning in every community, every part of this country for every last vote.
0	49.0		TRUMP	I’m running to be a president for all Americans.
0	50.0		TRUMP	I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti.
0	51.0		TRUMP	Good place.
0	52.0		TRUMP	Unbelievable people.
0	53.0		TRUMP	And I’m going to be campaigning hard for their votes.
0	54.0		TRUMP	And they are incredible people.
0	55.0		TRUMP	Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life — all.
0	56.0		TRUMP	All of them.
0	57.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, at Little Haiti they presented me with something that I figured I’d put on.
0	58.0		TRUMP	Is that OK to put it on?
0	59.0		TRUMP	They gave me that and I love it.
0	60.0		TRUMP	I think it’s great.
0	61.0		TRUMP	Your cops and soldiers — thank you.
0	62.0		TRUMP	I love you too.
0	63.0		TRUMP	Carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, Black, white and Hispanic.
0	64.0		TRUMP	But above all, we are together and we are Americans.
0	65.0		TRUMP	We got to pull our country together.
0	66.0		TRUMP	Just today I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor, brave people.
0	67.0		TRUMP	And many, many of our most amazing military leaders, generals, admirals, amazing people, real fighters.
0	68.0		TRUMP	They really know what they’re doing.
0	69.0		TRUMP	We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and admirals.
0	70.0		TRUMP	I didn’t know we had that many.
0	71.0		TRUMP	Well, we love them.
0	72.0		TRUMP	We also have the support of 16,500 border patrol officers.
0	73.0		TRUMP	The first time in the history of the border patrol that they’ve endorsed any presidential candidate.
0	74.0		TRUMP	As well as law enforcement officers, police, all across the country.
0	75.0		TRUMP	In fact, I’m very excited to announce tonight that we just received a few minutes ago the endorsement of the largest police union in the country, the Fraternal Order of Police.
0	76.0		TRUMP	Number one by far.
0	77.0		TRUMP	Pretty good.
0	78.0		TRUMP	Pretty good.
0	79.0		TRUMP	And we have the support of millions of patriotic moms and dads who go to work every day and make our country run.
0	80.0		TRUMP	While my opponent slanders you as deplorable — and irredeemable!
0	81.0		TRUMP	Boy that second word is tough.
0	82.0		TRUMP	You don’t hear that as much.
0	83.0		TRUMP	But that means you’re never going to come back, folks.
0	84.0		TRUMP	And I know you’re going to come back.
0	85.0		TRUMP	We’re going to come back so strong.
0	86.0		TRUMP	We’re going to be so strong.
0	87.0		TRUMP	Stronger than ever before.
0	88.0		TRUMP	Irredeemable.
0	89.0		TRUMP	They don’t talk about that one, but that was, to me, pretty bad.
0	90.0		TRUMP	I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and really, really, really love your country.
0	91.0		TRUMP	Love your country.
0	92.0		TRUMP	Clinton’s entire campaign rests on using a single tactic, and it’s not working very well.
0	93.0		TRUMP	She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads.
0	94.0		TRUMP	And we’re actually I think probably leading — based on everything we’re seeing — and we’ve spent practically nothing.
0	95.0		TRUMP	I’m proud of that.
0	96.0		TRUMP	And you know what?
0	97.0		TRUMP	We’re doing very well.
0	98.0		TRUMP	You know in the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer people and you were leading you got credit.
0	99.0		TRUMP	Today they say well, she’s spending much more money.
0	100.0		TRUMP	Yes, but she’s doing poorly, very poorly.
0	101.0		TRUMP	But what they do is they smear opponents — and you look at her history — and they question policies.
0	102.0		TRUMP	And they talk all the time about racist, racist.
0	103.0		TRUMP	It’s the only word they know.
0	104.0		TRUMP	They used it on Romney.
0	105.0		TRUMP	They used it on everybody.
0	106.0		TRUMP	They use it.
0	107.0		TRUMP	When they’re in trouble, they always pull out the racist word.
0	108.0		TRUMP	And they are in very big trouble, I have to tell you.
1	109.0		TRUMP	And for the most part we haven’t even started spending our money yet.
0	110.0		TRUMP	And we have raised a lot of money.
0	111.0		TRUMP	And I’m putting in my money.
0	112.0		TRUMP	And I put in a hell of a lot of money.
0	113.0		TRUMP	In fact, if things don’t work out, even though a lot of people are saying this was one of the great political phenomenas they’ve ever seen.
0	114.0		TRUMP	They’ve never seen — they call it a phenomena.
0	115.0		TRUMP	I will tell you.
0	116.0		TRUMP	If it doesn’t work out, it will be a tremendous waste of time, energy and money.
0	117.0		TRUMP	And she’s angry for even suggesting it.
0	118.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to — hey look, Nov. 8 you go and vote.
0	119.0		TRUMP	We’re winning.
0	120.0		TRUMP	I’ll tell you what.
0	121.0		TRUMP	If you vote, we’re winning.
0	122.0		TRUMP	There’s no way they can beat us.
0	123.0		TRUMP	There’s no way she can beat us because her people have no enthusiasm, whatsoever.
0	124.0		TRUMP	They’re not going to turn out.
0	125.0		TRUMP	They don’t have the enthusiasm.
0	126.0		TRUMP	Who could possibly have enthusiasm?
0	127.0		TRUMP	What are you getting?
0	128.0		TRUMP	You turn out, we’re winning big league.
0	129.0		TRUMP	And I think — and they’re all saying the Trump people are going to turn out.
0	130.0		TRUMP	We have a movement like they have never, ever seen in this country.
0	131.0		TRUMP	And they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher.
0	132.0		TRUMP	So I think, I have very little doubt, turnout we’re going to have a tremendous Nov. 8.
0	133.0		TRUMP	Probably we’ll say Nov. 8 plus the next four years and then four years after that, OK?
0	134.0		TRUMP	But the racist word, it’s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and Americans have had enough of it, OK.
0	135.0		TRUMP	We get it.
0	136.0		TRUMP	We get it.
0	137.0		TRUMP	I’ll tell you what, I just — I told you I just left Little Haiti.
0	138.0		TRUMP	The love is unbelievable.
0	139.0		TRUMP	It’s unbelievable.
0	140.0		TRUMP	There’s no racist.
0	141.0		TRUMP	There’s no nothing.
0	142.0		TRUMP	It’s love.
0	143.0		TRUMP	They want solutions.
0	144.0		TRUMP	They want better lives, not more petty attacks from failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked Hillary Clinton.
0	145.0		TRUMP	They want their immigration laws enforced and their border secured.
0	146.0		TRUMP	Let’s win on Nov. 8, OK?
0	147.0		TRUMP	That’ll be —
0	148.0		TRUMP	They’re patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and their families protected.
0	149.0		TRUMP	They want protection.
0	150.0		TRUMP	People who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes.
0	151.0		TRUMP	Everyone’s an Islamophobe.
0	152.0		TRUMP	You mention something you’re an Islamophobe.
0	153.0		TRUMP	You know they come up with words.
0	154.0		TRUMP	Hey, I went to Ivy League school.
0	155.0		TRUMP	I did very well — great.
0	156.0		TRUMP	They have so many new words.
0	157.0		TRUMP	Islamophobe.
1	158.0		TRUMP	We have a president — and frankly Hillary — who don’t use the words radical Islamic terrorism.
0	159.0		TRUMP	And if you don’t know what you’re fighting, you’re not going to fight it very well.
0	160.0		TRUMP	And we’ve proven that.
0	161.0		TRUMP	We have decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.
0	162.0		TRUMP	We want to keep our country safe.
0	163.0		TRUMP	People who support the police, who want crime reduced and ended, and who are not prejudiced.
1	164.0		TRUMP	They’re concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed, violently, on the streets, which is happening all over our country.
0	165.0		TRUMP	Yet while Hillary Clinton lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge funds — you know look what she’s doing with these hedge funds, raising millions and millions.
0	166.0		TRUMP	I know so many of these people.
0	167.0		TRUMP	Give me a break.
0	168.0		TRUMP	The hedge fund and the Wall Street donors she slanders and smears with her statements last week.
0	169.0		TRUMP	Working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her.
1	170.0		TRUMP	Now you know she’s very much against the Second Amendment.
1	171.0		TRUMP	She wants to destroy your Second Amendment.
0	172.0		TRUMP	Guns, guns, guns, right.
0	173.0		TRUMP	I think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before.
0	174.0		TRUMP	I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons.
0	175.0		TRUMP	They should disarm, right?
0	176.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	177.0		TRUMP	I think they should disarm immediately.
0	178.0		TRUMP	What do you think?
0	179.0		TRUMP	Yes?
0	180.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	181.0		TRUMP	Take their guns away.
1	182.0		TRUMP	She doesn’t want guns.
0	183.0		TRUMP	Take their — let’s see what happens to her.
0	184.0		TRUMP	Take their guns away.
0	185.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	186.0		TRUMP	It’d be very dangerous.
0	187.0		TRUMP	Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones — with a hammer!
0	188.0		TRUMP	With a hammer!
0	189.0		TRUMP	Thirteen of them.
0	190.0		TRUMP	Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation.
0	191.0		TRUMP	It’s the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world.
0	192.0		TRUMP	Everything she touched, it just didn’t work out.
0	193.0		TRUMP	Certainly it didn’t work out for our country.
1	194.0		TRUMP	It’s the same reason why she won’t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.
1	195.0		TRUMP	Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.
0	196.0		TRUMP	We see it.
0	197.0		TRUMP	Look, we see it.
0	198.0		TRUMP	I drove here.
0	199.0		TRUMP	We see it.
0	200.0		TRUMP	We see it.
0	201.0		TRUMP	I’m running to reverse these failures.
0	202.0		TRUMP	And they are incredible failures.
0	203.0		TRUMP	And create a new American future.
0	204.0		TRUMP	And that future begins with prosperity at home.
0	205.0		TRUMP	My economic agenda can be summed up in three words.
0	206.0		TRUMP	And you’re going to like these three words.
0	207.0		TRUMP	Jobs, jobs, jobs.
0	208.0		TRUMP	One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.
0	209.0		TRUMP	African-American communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.
0	210.0		TRUMP	Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century, for 60 years, 75 years, even in some cases 100 years straight.
0	211.0		TRUMP	Unabated.
0	212.0		TRUMP	Unbroken.
0	213.0		TRUMP	Over 100 years.
0	214.0		TRUMP	They control the mayor’s offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress.
0	215.0		TRUMP	And all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and more failing schools.
0	216.0		TRUMP	Sixty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six now live in poverty.
0	217.0		TRUMP	More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago this year.
0	218.0		TRUMP	This year.
0	219.0		TRUMP	Think of it, since Jan. 1.
1	220.0		TRUMP	Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.
1	221.0		TRUMP	Can’t get a job.
0	222.0		TRUMP	These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.
0	223.0		TRUMP	And everyone knows that if she’s elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache.
0	224.0		TRUMP	Amazing people.
0	225.0		TRUMP	Amazing country.
0	226.0		TRUMP	We have an amazing country.
0	227.0		TRUMP	And honestly you see the crime statistics.
0	228.0		TRUMP	You’re African-American.
0	229.0		TRUMP	You have the inner city problems that have been going on for ever.
0	230.0		TRUMP	Forever.
0	231.0		TRUMP	You have problems like nobody has.
0	232.0		TRUMP	And you look at crime.
0	233.0		TRUMP	You look at schools.
0	234.0		TRUMP	You look at no jobs.
0	235.0		TRUMP	Look at the worst education.
0	236.0		TRUMP	Look how dangerous.
0	237.0		TRUMP	You can’t walk down the street.
0	238.0		TRUMP	You get shot or your child gets shot.
0	239.0		TRUMP	And I’ve been saying it, and I’ll say it openly — and some people like it and some people don’t like it, and I don’t really care.
0	240.0		TRUMP	What do you have to lose?
0	241.0		TRUMP	I will fix it.
0	242.0		TRUMP	I’m going to fix it.
0	243.0		TRUMP	We’re going to fix our inner cities.
0	244.0		TRUMP	We’re going to make them safe.
0	245.0		TRUMP	We’re going to bring jobs back.
0	246.0		TRUMP	So to the African-American people within the community, what do you have to lose?
0	247.0		TRUMP	It can’t get — honestly, it can’t get — that’s so nice, thank you.
0	248.0		TRUMP	It can’t get any worse.
0	249.0		TRUMP	It can’t get any worse.
0	250.0		TRUMP	It can’t get any worse.
0	251.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	252.0		TRUMP	So nice.
0	253.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	254.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	255.0		TRUMP	It can’t get any worse, the crime, the jobs.
0	256.0		TRUMP	No jobs.
0	257.0		TRUMP	No education.
0	258.0		TRUMP	Worst education.
0	259.0		TRUMP	More unsafe — you go to Afghanistan, right.
0	260.0		TRUMP	We hear Afghanistan.
0	261.0		TRUMP	I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.
0	262.0		TRUMP	Inner cities.
0	263.0		TRUMP	African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers.
0	264.0		TRUMP	You watch.
0	265.0		TRUMP	We’re going to fix it.
0	266.0		TRUMP	Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years.
0	267.0		TRUMP	Her disastrous record speaks for itself.
0	268.0		TRUMP	And I have to tell you.
0	269.0		TRUMP	When she ran for the United States Senate in New York, we have upstate New York which is a total disaster, economic disaster.
0	270.0		TRUMP	She said she’s going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs.
0	271.0		TRUMP	She — anyway, she gets elected.
1	272.0		TRUMP	We lost our jobs.
1	273.0		TRUMP	It got worse.
0	274.0		TRUMP	She didn’t do anything.
0	275.0		TRUMP	She didn’t do anything.
0	276.0		TRUMP	She went home.
0	277.0		TRUMP	She went to sleep, OK.
0	278.0		TRUMP	She didn’t do anything.
0	279.0		TRUMP	She didn’t do anything.
1	280.0		TRUMP	It got worse.
1	281.0		TRUMP	Far worse now, it’s a total catastrophe.
0	282.0		TRUMP	Just remember that.
0	283.0		TRUMP	When she tells you about jobs, when she tells you she’s going to fix trade deals, she wouldn’t know where to begin.
0	284.0		TRUMP	She wouldn’t know where to begin.
0	285.0		TRUMP	And besides that, to do that kind of thing, to negotiate great trade deals, to re-enhance our — I mean look.
0	286.0		TRUMP	Our military is so depleted.
0	287.0		TRUMP	We have the greatest people on earth.
0	288.0		TRUMP	They’re using equipment that’s old.
0	289.0		TRUMP	They’re flying planes that are old.
0	290.0		TRUMP	You see what’s happening.
0	291.0		TRUMP	It’s a depleted military.
0	292.0		TRUMP	We have to have a strong military.
0	293.0		TRUMP	We have to take care of our vets.
0	294.0		TRUMP	We have to take care of our vets.
0	295.0		TRUMP	But to do these things you need a lot of energy.
1	296.0		TRUMP	And she does not have the energy.
1	297.0		TRUMP	And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.
0	298.0		TRUMP	The only people that she will deliver for, frankly, are her donors and her special interests.
0	299.0		TRUMP	I’m going to deliver for you, believe me.
0	300.0		TRUMP	The American people.
0	301.0		TRUMP	We’re going to deliver.
0	302.0		TRUMP	You’re gonna be happy.
0	303.0		TRUMP	And those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably, not probably.
0	304.0		TRUMP	Like they have never seen.
0	305.0		TRUMP	You watch.
0	306.0		TRUMP	Like they have never seen.
0	307.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
1	308.0		TRUMP	If we lower our taxes and we’re getting a massive tax reduction — and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially.
0	309.0		TRUMP	If we remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy.
0	310.0		TRUMP	We have so much energy.
0	311.0		TRUMP	It’s being destroyed, our economic worth.
0	312.0		TRUMP	And negotiate trade deals that put America first.
0	313.0		TRUMP	Then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.
0	314.0		TRUMP	There is no limit.
0	315.0		TRUMP	Pay off our debt.
0	316.0		TRUMP	Pay down our debt.
0	317.0		TRUMP	Reduce taxes.
0	318.0		TRUMP	Get rid of regulations.
0	319.0		TRUMP	My first day in office I’m going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last 10 years.
0	320.0		TRUMP	All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled.
0	321.0		TRUMP	Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.
0	322.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to lift the restrictions on American energy — which means at least another half a million jobs each year.
0	323.0		TRUMP	They are being destroyed.
0	324.0		TRUMP	And we’re unable to compete with other nations.
0	325.0		TRUMP	Very simple.
0	326.0		TRUMP	And that’s just the beginning.
0	327.0		TRUMP	Also on my first day I’m going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
0	328.0		TRUMP	It has turned out to be a disaster.
1	329.0		TRUMP	This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.
0	330.0		TRUMP	And if you look at your premiums, it’s through the roof.
1	331.0		TRUMP	And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases.
1	332.0		TRUMP	They want to delay it until after the election because it’s election — it’s a disaster.
0	333.0		TRUMP	It’s a disaster.
0	334.0		TRUMP	And your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long, slow, vicious death, you’re never going to be able to use it, OK.
0	335.0		TRUMP	Do you see the deductibles?
0	336.0		TRUMP	You’re never going to be able to use it.
0	337.0		TRUMP	I’m also going to completely reform our trade deals.
0	338.0		TRUMP	We’re going to renegotiate NAFTA.
0	339.0		TRUMP	Probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to, signed in the history of the world, not in the United States.
0	340.0		TRUMP	It’s destroyed our manufacturing in our country.
0	341.0		TRUMP	It’s destroyed.
0	342.0		TRUMP	And by the way, guess who signed it?
1	343.0		TRUMP	Bill Clinton.
0	344.0		TRUMP	You look at all of the places, Florida included.
0	345.0		TRUMP	But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania.
1	346.0		TRUMP	You look at all of these different places have been destroyed.
1	347.0		TRUMP	Absolutely destroyed.
0	348.0		TRUMP	You look at New England.
0	349.0		TRUMP	Look what happened to New England.
0	350.0		TRUMP	They’ve been destroyed by companies moving out, going into Mexico, firing everybody.
0	351.0		TRUMP	Unemployment through the roof.
0	352.0		TRUMP	We’re going to stand up to China, and keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — another catastrophe.
0	353.0		TRUMP	TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
0	354.0		TRUMP	Nothing can be as bad as NAFTA.
0	355.0		TRUMP	Trans-Pacific Partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
0	356.0		TRUMP	It’ll take your jobs, Ohio.
0	357.0		TRUMP	Remember, it’s going to take your jobs, Ohio.
0	358.0		TRUMP	I tell you that.
0	359.0		TRUMP	Michigan.
0	360.0		TRUMP	So many places.
0	361.0		TRUMP	TPP is a disaster.
0	362.0		TRUMP	We don’t need another massive multinational deal, by the way, that nobody on our side even reads, that ties us up and binds us down and doesn’t even discuss monetary manipulation and devaluation, which is how China and all these countries are beating us so badly.
0	363.0		TRUMP	Not even discussed.
0	364.0		TRUMP	And they had provisions in the agreement, and they would take it out because certain politicians didn’t want to have them in there.
0	365.0		TRUMP	I wonder why.
0	366.0		TRUMP	Another major reform is going to be school choice.
0	367.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to terminate Common Core.
1	368.0		TRUMP	And we’re bringing our education local.
0	369.0		TRUMP	I’ve outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.
0	370.0		TRUMP	This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, something we are going to do.
1	371.0		TRUMP	Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty.
0	372.0		TRUMP	It’s catastrophic.
0	373.0		TRUMP	And it’s totally unacceptable.
0	374.0		TRUMP	To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs.
0	375.0		TRUMP	We’re going to build up your schools.
0	376.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.
0	377.0		TRUMP	You have no safety.
0	378.0		TRUMP	You have little opportunity.
0	379.0		TRUMP	This week I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality child care for their children.
0	380.0		TRUMP	Child care.
0	381.0		TRUMP	Ivanka Trump, very much for child care.
0	382.0		TRUMP	She’s been talking about that to me for two years, long before I even decided to go through this journey.
0	383.0		TRUMP	And it’s not easy, I want to tell you.
0	384.0		TRUMP	We speak in rooms like this.
0	385.0		TRUMP	This is about 100 degrees right now.
0	386.0		TRUMP	That’s considered a cool auditorium.
0	387.0		TRUMP	And the reason is we have such big crowds like this one.
0	388.0		TRUMP	Look at that.
0	389.0		TRUMP	Every single corner.
0	390.0		TRUMP	Unbelievable.
0	391.0		TRUMP	These rooms weren’t designed for this many people.
0	392.0		TRUMP	And it is hot in these rooms.
0	393.0		TRUMP	And we stand up here and we talk.
0	394.0		TRUMP	And we do two or three and sometimes we’ll be hitting four a day.
0	395.0		TRUMP	Do you think Hillary Clinton can get through one?
1	396.0		TRUMP	You ever see her 18-minute speech?
0	397.0		TRUMP	Bomb.
0	398.0		TRUMP	Bomb.
0	399.0		TRUMP	Bomb.
0	400.0		TRUMP	See ya.
0	401.0		TRUMP	See ya, I’m going home.
0	402.0		TRUMP	No.
0	403.0		TRUMP	We’re doing it the right way.
1	404.0		TRUMP	And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I don’t have to because I do it the old fashioned way.
0	405.0		TRUMP	I come into your neighborhood, right.
0	406.0		TRUMP	It’s a lot cheaper.
0	407.0		TRUMP	It’s a lot harder work, but it’s a lot cheaper.
0	408.0		TRUMP	Very true.
0	409.0		TRUMP	Very, very true.
0	410.0		TRUMP	On policy after policy we’re going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.
0	411.0		TRUMP	We’re also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against Communist oppression.
0	412.0		TRUMP	No, we’re on the right side.
0	413.0		TRUMP	Great people.
0	414.0		TRUMP	They’re great people.
0	415.0		TRUMP	The president’s one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the Castro regime.
0	416.0		TRUMP	People are very unhappy about it.
0	417.0		TRUMP	You know what’s interesting?
0	418.0		TRUMP	When he landed the plane recently in China, right, they refused to give him a stairway out of Air Force One.
1	419.0		TRUMP	Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One.
0	420.0		TRUMP	So he used basically the mechanics’ stairs.
0	421.0		TRUMP	That’s the stairs they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light bulb, right.
0	422.0		TRUMP	When he landed the plane in Saudi Arabia, which we protect.
0	423.0		TRUMP	Without us they wouldn’t be there for two months.
0	424.0		TRUMP	He landed in Saudi Arabia.
0	425.0		TRUMP	He wasn’t greeted by the top officials.
0	426.0		TRUMP	Now what would I have done in those two cases?
0	427.0		TRUMP	Bomb.
0	428.0		TRUMP	Take me back to Washington, Jim.
0	429.0		TRUMP	Let’s go.
0	430.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	431.0		TRUMP	Let’s go.
0	432.0		TRUMP	Let’s go, Jim.
0	433.0		TRUMP	Get going.
0	434.0		TRUMP	Close those doors.
0	435.0		TRUMP	We’re going home.
0	436.0		TRUMP	Now with Cuba, with Cuba we land in Cuba and there’s no Castro to greet him.
0	437.0		TRUMP	The big leaders weren’t there to greet him.
0	438.0		TRUMP	And I have a lot of Cuban friends.
0	439.0		TRUMP	But you would have all done the same thing again.
0	440.0		TRUMP	Jim, let’s close those doors.
0	441.0		TRUMP	We’re going home.
0	442.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	443.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	444.0		TRUMP	Let’s go, captain.
0	445.0		TRUMP	We’re going home.
0	446.0		TRUMP	We’re going into Washington.
0	447.0		TRUMP	Maybe we’ll head into Miami actually.
0	448.0		TRUMP	That’s not a bad idea.
0	449.0		TRUMP	Terrible.
0	450.0		TRUMP	That’s three.
0	451.0		TRUMP	Three.
0	452.0		TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, Cuba, China.
1	453.0		TRUMP	Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history.
0	454.0		TRUMP	Air Force One used to land and people would respect the people inside.
0	455.0		TRUMP	And they’d come out and there’d be all sorts of hoopla.
0	456.0		TRUMP	Not anymore.
0	457.0		TRUMP	It’s unbelievable.
0	458.0		TRUMP	And these are countries that have benefited by us greatly.
0	459.0		TRUMP	So we have to make great deals before we do anything with Cuba or anybody else, right.
0	460.0		TRUMP	We’re going to make great deals.
0	461.0		TRUMP	You’ll be happy.
0	462.0		TRUMP	You’re going to be happy, I tell you.
0	463.0		TRUMP	How many people are from Cuba here?
0	464.0		TRUMP	Come here.
0	465.0		TRUMP	Tell me.
0	466.0		TRUMP	Cuban.
0	467.0		TRUMP	Cuban.
0	468.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	469.0		TRUMP	Do you agree with me?
0	470.0		TRUMP	Do you agree?
0	471.0		TRUMP	We’ll do it.
0	472.0		TRUMP	But we’ll do it with great deals.
0	473.0		TRUMP	And we’ll do it with democracy.
0	474.0		TRUMP	And we’ll do it the way we have to do it.
0	475.0		TRUMP	OK?
0	476.0		TRUMP	We’ll do it the right way.
0	477.0		TRUMP	Where is Ms.
0	478.0		TRUMP	Delgado?
0	479.0		TRUMP	Does everybody know?
0	480.0		TRUMP	What a great — where is she?
0	481.0		TRUMP	She is so amazing.
0	482.0		TRUMP	A.J.
0	483.0		TRUMP	Where is A.J.
0	484.0		TRUMP	Wow, she’s so — she’s become a tremendous star.
0	485.0		TRUMP	Tell you one thing, when she’s representing me I wouldn’t do it anyway, but I can.
0	486.0		TRUMP	Turn off the television.
0	487.0		TRUMP	I’m well protected.
0	488.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	489.0		TRUMP	Great job.
0	490.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	491.0		TRUMP	Thank you, A.J.
0	492.0		TRUMP	But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them.
0	493.0		TRUMP	And that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands.
0	494.0		TRUMP	Not my demands, our demands.
0	495.0		TRUMP	You know what the demands are.
0	496.0		TRUMP	Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.
0	497.0		TRUMP	And the freeing of political prisoners.
0	498.0		TRUMP	The freeing of political prisoners.
0	499.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	500.0		TRUMP	Am I — is that right?
0	501.0		TRUMP	Oh boy.
0	502.0		TRUMP	Oh boy.
0	503.0		TRUMP	What energy in this room.
0	504.0		TRUMP	What energy.
0	505.0		TRUMP	A lot of energy.
0	506.0		TRUMP	You’ll be very happy, my Cuban friends.
0	507.0		TRUMP	I have so many friends from Cuba.
0	508.0		TRUMP	Incredible people.
0	509.0		TRUMP	So let’s also talk about a place called Venezuela.
0	510.0		TRUMP	They — now who’s here from Venezuela?
0	511.0		TRUMP	Or related in some — not too many.
0	512.0		TRUMP	Whoa.
0	513.0		TRUMP	Whoa.
0	514.0		TRUMP	What’s going on?
0	515.0		TRUMP	Not too many?
0	516.0		TRUMP	Friend or foe?
0	517.0		TRUMP	I think he’s friend.
0	518.0		TRUMP	I think he’s friend.
0	519.0		TRUMP	No, he’s OK.
0	520.0		TRUMP	He’s OK.
0	521.0		TRUMP	By the way, is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?
0	522.0		TRUMP	You tell me.
0	523.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	524.0		TRUMP	Tell you.
0	525.0		TRUMP	We have a lot of Venezuelans around Doral, the Doral section, right.
0	526.0		TRUMP	And it’s a beautiful, vibrant — this is an amazing place.
0	527.0		TRUMP	But they are really having trouble over in Venezuela.
0	528.0		TRUMP	But Miami is filled with hardworking, incredible Venezuelan people.
0	529.0		TRUMP	But it’s been hurt very badly by Socialist Venezuela.
0	530.0		TRUMP	And the next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere.
0	531.0		TRUMP	And we will stand with oppressed people.
0	532.0		TRUMP	And there are many.
0	533.0		TRUMP	The oppressed people of Venezuela, they are yearning to be free.
0	534.0		TRUMP	They are yearning for help.
0	535.0		TRUMP	The system is bad.
0	536.0		TRUMP	But the people are great.
0	537.0		TRUMP	Great.
0	538.0		TRUMP	They are great people.
0	539.0		TRUMP	Here in America I’ll push to expand freedom for all of our citizens.
0	540.0		TRUMP	I’m going to lower your taxes so substantially.
0	541.0		TRUMP	We’re getting rid of all of those regulations on business.
0	542.0		TRUMP	So many small business owners here, I know five of them.
0	543.0		TRUMP	One of them was small business now he’s big business.
0	544.0		TRUMP	I’m proud of him.
0	545.0		TRUMP	He’s right here.
0	546.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to get rid of those terrible, terrible regulations.
0	547.0		TRUMP	He just said to me, and the thing that surprised me most, we’re bringing business tax rates down from 35 percent to 15 percent.
0	548.0		TRUMP	And yet — it’ll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country.
0	549.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts, they’re more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people, jobs.
0	550.0		TRUMP	So I’m going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution.
0	551.0		TRUMP	I’m going to rebuild our depleted — we’re going to take care of our, the vets.
0	552.0		TRUMP	Who’s a vet?
0	553.0		TRUMP	Who’s a vet?
0	554.0		TRUMP	Where are my vets?
0	555.0		TRUMP	Where are they?
0	556.0		TRUMP	There they — OK.
0	557.0		TRUMP	Now they’re standing up.
0	558.0		TRUMP	Now they — I know we had a lot of vets here.
0	559.0		TRUMP	Thank you, fellas.
0	560.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	561.0		TRUMP	We’re going to take care of our vets.
0	562.0		TRUMP	We’re going to save your Second Amendment.
0	563.0		TRUMP	Do you know if you look at some of the things, the catastrophes — you look at Orlando.
0	564.0		TRUMP	You look at San Bernardino.
0	565.0		TRUMP	You look at so many different — you look at Paris.
0	566.0		TRUMP	The toughest gun laws in the world, they have it in Paris.
0	567.0		TRUMP	These thugs, these animals walked in and they just go bomb, bomb, bomb.
1	568.0		TRUMP	Nobody had guns on the other side.
1	569.0		TRUMP	If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldn’t have attacked.
0	570.0		TRUMP	And number two, even if they did attack, it would’ve been a whole different story.
0	571.0		TRUMP	One hundred thirty people killed.
0	572.0		TRUMP	People massively injured, still in the hospital.
0	573.0		TRUMP	Their lives are just destroyed.
1	574.0		TRUMP	And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it would’ve been a whole different story.
0	575.0		TRUMP	So we’re going to protect your Second Amendment.
0	576.0		TRUMP	And I’m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into our country.
0	577.0		TRUMP	And yes, we will build a wall.
0	578.0		TRUMP	We’ll build a wall.
0	579.0		TRUMP	We will build a wall.
0	580.0		TRUMP	Who’s going to pay for the wall?
0	581.0		TRUMP	One hundred percent.
0	582.0		TRUMP	One hundred percent.
0	583.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to be renegotiating NAFTA and our terrible trade deals.
0	584.0		TRUMP	We’re going to make great deals out of horrible deals.
0	585.0		TRUMP	And if we can’t renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, we’re going to terminate the deal and we’ll start all over again, folks.
0	586.0		TRUMP	We’ll have new deals.
0	587.0		TRUMP	And they’ll be much better deals.
0	588.0		TRUMP	And they’ll be two-way streets.
0	589.0		TRUMP	The traffic, it’ll be coming our way.
0	590.0		TRUMP	It’s a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money.
0	591.0		TRUMP	You know I always say we get the drugs, they get the cash.
0	592.0		TRUMP	That’s the deal, folks.
0	593.0		TRUMP	No good.
0	594.0		TRUMP	They’re building in Mexico right now, and Mexico’s just one example, some of the greatest plants.
0	595.0		TRUMP	A friend of mine builds plants.
0	596.0		TRUMP	And he tells me all the time — I called him up the other day.
0	597.0		TRUMP	I called him up six months ago, told me the same thing.
0	598.0		TRUMP	Nothing changes.
0	599.0		TRUMP	Ford.
1	600.0		TRUMP	They just announced yesterday they’re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico.
0	601.0		TRUMP	That’s on top of spending billions and billions of dollars.
0	602.0		TRUMP	And then you wonder why I’m winning in Michigan.
0	603.0		TRUMP	Because I’ve been telling the people in Michigan.
0	604.0		TRUMP	I’ve been telling the people in Ohio for five years that this is happening.
0	605.0		TRUMP	And our politicians don’t do anything about it.
0	606.0		TRUMP	And Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it.
0	607.0		TRUMP	She doesn’t have the capability to do it.
0	608.0		TRUMP	We will rebuild our roads and bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.
0	609.0		TRUMP	American cars will travel the roads.
0	610.0		TRUMP	American planes will soar in the sky.
0	611.0		TRUMP	They’ll soar.
0	612.0		TRUMP	And American ships will patrol the seas.
0	613.0		TRUMP	American steel will send new skyscrapers right here in Miami into the clouds.
0	614.0		TRUMP	But it’ll be American steel.
0	615.0		TRUMP	American hands will rebuild this nation.
0	616.0		TRUMP	And American energy mined from American sources will power our energy.
0	617.0		TRUMP	And we’ll take care of our steel workers.
0	618.0		TRUMP	And we’ll take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration, destroyed.
1	619.0		TRUMP	And Hillary Clinton has already said she’s going to put the miners out of business.
0	620.0		TRUMP	We’re going to take care of our miners.
0	621.0		TRUMP	They’re amazing people.
0	622.0		TRUMP	American workers will be hired to do the job.
0	623.0		TRUMP	We will put new American steel into the spine of our country.
0	624.0		TRUMP	I will fight for every neglected part of this nation.
0	625.0		TRUMP	And I will fight to bring us all together as one people.
0	626.0		TRUMP	Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.
0	627.0		TRUMP	It’s time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.
0	628.0		TRUMP	We’re not prosperous anymore.
0	629.0		TRUMP	We owe $20 trillion.
0	630.0		TRUMP	We have a president who in seven-and-a-half years has doubled the debt.
0	631.0		TRUMP	Our country’s in trouble.
0	632.0		TRUMP	A lot of people don’t know it, but our country’s in trouble.
0	633.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to make sure that trouble never comes.
0	634.0		TRUMP	Let me tell you.
0	635.0		TRUMP	Jobs will return.
0	636.0		TRUMP	Incomes will rise.
0	637.0		TRUMP	And new factories will come rushing back to our shores.
0	638.0		TRUMP	Once more we will have a government of, by and for the people.
0	639.0		TRUMP	We will make America wealthy again.
0	640.0		TRUMP	We will make America safe again.
0	641.0		TRUMP	We will make America strong again.
0	642.0		TRUMP	And we will make America great again.
0	643.0		TRUMP	Thank you, everybody.
0	644.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	645.0		TRUMP	Thank you, Miami.
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.
0	2.0		TRUMP	We’ve had a great three days at the United Nations in New York.
0	3.0		TRUMP	And this is quite a gathering.
0	4.0		TRUMP	Wow.
0	5.0		TRUMP	It’s a lot of people.
0	6.0		TRUMP	A lot of media.
0	7.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	8.0		TRUMP	We’ve covered a great deal of territory.
0	9.0		TRUMP	Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan.
0	10.0		TRUMP	We’re starting trade talks with Japan.
0	11.0		TRUMP	They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they’re willing to talk trade.
0	12.0		TRUMP	And I’m sure we’ll make a very good deal.
0	13.0		TRUMP	Just concluded, as you know — two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea — a trade deal.
0	14.0		TRUMP	A tremendous deal with South Korea.
0	15.0		TRUMP	It means a lot of business for our farmers.
0	16.0		TRUMP	We’re opening up for farmers.
0	17.0		TRUMP	We’re opening up for a lot of different groups.
0	18.0		TRUMP	We’re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before.
0	19.0		TRUMP	And so we’re very happy with that.
0	20.0		TRUMP	That deal is actually concluded.
0	21.0		TRUMP	We’re very well along the way with Mexico.
0	22.0		TRUMP	The relationship is very good.
0	23.0		TRUMP	And with Canada, we’ll see what happens.
0	24.0		TRUMP	They’re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.
0	25.0		TRUMP	We can’t have that.
0	26.0		TRUMP	We can’t have that.
0	27.0		TRUMP	With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today.
0	28.0		TRUMP	They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.
0	29.0		TRUMP	But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies.
0	30.0		TRUMP	And China is not open, but we’re open to them.
0	31.0		TRUMP	They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country.
0	32.0		TRUMP	Cars, they’re at 25 percent.
0	33.0		TRUMP	And we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and don’t even collect it.
0	34.0		TRUMP	But we collect it now.
0	35.0		TRUMP	So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.
0	36.0		TRUMP	I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi.
0	37.0		TRUMP	But it’s got to be a two-way street.
0	38.0		TRUMP	It — for 25 years and longer, it was not.
0	39.0		TRUMP	And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.
0	40.0		TRUMP	We just can’t have that.
0	41.0		TRUMP	We have to make it fair.
0	42.0		TRUMP	So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.
0	43.0		TRUMP	And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.
0	44.0		TRUMP	And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t.
0	45.0		TRUMP	In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is.
0	46.0		TRUMP	If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.
0	47.0		TRUMP	They dump massive amounts of steel.
0	48.0		TRUMP	They want to put the steel companies out of business.
0	49.0		TRUMP	And after they’re out of business, they’ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.
0	50.0		TRUMP	And we need steel and we need aluminum.
0	51.0		TRUMP	And those industries are doing well.
0	52.0		TRUMP	But steel is incredible.
1	53.0		TRUMP	U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.
0	54.0		TRUMP	Nucor is opening up plants.
0	55.0		TRUMP	And these are big plants — $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases.
0	56.0		TRUMP	So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.
0	57.0		TRUMP	It’s being rebuilt overnight.
0	58.0		TRUMP	If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG — Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible.
0	59.0		TRUMP	They’re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.
0	60.0		TRUMP	They’re taking the LNG and they’re doubling it up.
0	61.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""You have to do me a favor. We don’t want these big deficits. You’re going to have to buy more"""
0	62.0		TRUMP	They’re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing.
0	63.0		TRUMP	Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.
0	64.0		TRUMP	It’s a rare exception that we don’t.
0	65.0		TRUMP	So we are doing great as a country.
0	66.0		TRUMP	Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well.
0	67.0		TRUMP	I’m not happy about that, because I know it’s going to be a question.
0	68.0		TRUMP	I am not happy about that.
0	69.0		TRUMP	I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs.
0	70.0		TRUMP	So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.
0	71.0		TRUMP	We can do other things with the money.
0	72.0		TRUMP	And — but they raised them.
0	73.0		TRUMP	And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.
0	74.0		TRUMP	You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.
0	75.0		TRUMP	And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on.
0	76.0		TRUMP	They were going to put regulations on.
0	77.0		TRUMP	They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse.
0	78.0		TRUMP	And they were going to raise your taxes.
0	79.0		TRUMP	That’s what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don’t think they’ll have control for a long time.
0	80.0		TRUMP	So, with that being said, we’ll take some questions and — yes, please.
0	81.0		TRUMP	John, go ahead.
0	82.0		TRUMP	We have plenty of time.
0	83.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, thank you very much.
0	84.0		QUESTION	Of course, what you’re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh —
0	85.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	86.0		QUESTION	— before the Judiciary Committee.
0	87.0		QUESTION	In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas’s background investigation — not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation.
0	88.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	89.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	90.0		QUESTION	When these allegations were raised, why didn’t this White House do the same thing?
0	91.0		QUESTION	And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?
0	92.0		TRUMP	Well, the FBI told us they’ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years.
0	93.0		TRUMP	They know him very well.
1	94.0		TRUMP	But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.
1	95.0		TRUMP	They didn’t know the location.
1	96.0		TRUMP	They didn’t know the time.
1	97.0		TRUMP	They didn’t know the year.
1	98.0		TRUMP	They didn’t know anything.
0	99.0		TRUMP	And it’s like, where do you go?
0	100.0		TRUMP	Also, it’s not for the FBI.
1	101.0		TRUMP	"If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, ""They don’t do this"""
0	102.0		TRUMP	And he said it very clearly.
0	103.0		TRUMP	So I think when you really look at it all, it’s not going to change any of the Democrats’ minds.
0	104.0		TRUMP	They’re obstructionists.
0	105.0		TRUMP	They’re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they’ve destroyed a man’s reputation and they want to destroy it even more.
0	106.0		TRUMP	And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.
0	107.0		TRUMP	What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children — these beautiful children of his — and what they’ve done to his wife.
0	108.0		TRUMP	And they know it’s a big, fat con job.
0	109.0		TRUMP	And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they’ve pulled off on you and on the public.
0	110.0		TRUMP	They laugh like hell.
0	111.0		TRUMP	So, it wouldn’t have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score.
0	112.0		TRUMP	And you understand that very well, John.
0	113.0		TRUMP	"If they would have come back with the most perfect — ""We found everything, and he’s perfectly innocent of everything"""
0	114.0		TRUMP	It wouldn’t have made a difference.
0	115.0		TRUMP	You wouldn’t have gotten one vote.
0	116.0		TRUMP	Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win.
0	117.0		TRUMP	You’ll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they’re in states that I won by 30 and 40 points and they’re going to give us votes.
0	118.0		TRUMP	But other than that, you probably won’t get any, John.
0	119.0		TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
0	120.0		TRUMP	Please.
0	121.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
0	122.0		QUESTION	Are you saying that all three of those women are liars?
0	123.0		QUESTION	Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow —
0	124.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	125.0		QUESTION	— that could cause you to withdraw the nomination?
0	126.0		QUESTION	Anything at all that —
0	127.0		TRUMP	I won’t get into that game.
0	128.0		TRUMP	I’ll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I’ve ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing.
0	129.0		TRUMP	And these are all false — to me, these are false accusations in certain cases.
0	130.0		TRUMP	And certain cases, even the media agrees with that.
0	131.0		TRUMP	I can only say that, what they’ve done to this man is incredible.
0	132.0		TRUMP	You know, it’s very interesting — I pick a lot of judges.
0	133.0		TRUMP	I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn’t big on picking judges.
0	134.0		TRUMP	"When I got there, I said, ""How is this possible?"""
0	135.0		TRUMP	I have 145 — including court of appeals — judges.
0	136.0		TRUMP	And they just didn’t do it.
0	137.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	138.0		TRUMP	They got tired.
0	139.0		TRUMP	They got complacent.
0	140.0		TRUMP	Something happened.
0	141.0		TRUMP	I have 145 judges.
0	142.0		TRUMP	Everybody wants to be a federal judge.
0	143.0		TRUMP	Not just a Supreme Court judge, I’m talking about court of appeals; I’m talking about district court.
0	144.0		TRUMP	I don’t think they’re going to want to so much.
0	145.0		TRUMP	I’ll be calling people, and we’ll have people calling people that do this.
0	146.0		TRUMP	"And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, ""Thirty-five years ago, you met some…"" — and you might know — you might not know what’s going on."
0	147.0		TRUMP	What is going on?
0	148.0		TRUMP	Why did they wait so long?
0	149.0		TRUMP	Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?
0	150.0		TRUMP	Why didn’t she bring it right at the beginning?
0	151.0		TRUMP	When you ask about, as an example, the FBI — why didn’t they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing?
0	152.0		TRUMP	You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI.
0	153.0		TRUMP	It would have been fine.
0	154.0		TRUMP	Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times.
0	155.0		TRUMP	And they did a very thorough investigation.
0	156.0		TRUMP	But this is a big con job.
0	157.0		TRUMP	And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door — you guys are all away, outside, waiting.
0	158.0		TRUMP	And Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all.
0	159.0		TRUMP	Let’s just stop them.
0	160.0		TRUMP	A big fat con.
0	161.0		TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead.
0	162.0		QUESTION	But, Mr. President, if I could follow up.
0	163.0		QUESTION	You have daughters.
0	164.0		QUESTION	Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time?
0	165.0		QUESTION	Don’t you understand —
0	166.0		TRUMP	By the way, I only say this: thirty-six years — no charge, no nothing.
0	167.0		TRUMP	Everybody —
0	168.0		QUESTION	But — but that happens often.
0	169.0		QUESTION	I mean —
0	170.0		TRUMP	People are going to have to make a decision.
0	171.0		TRUMP	Thirty-six years, there’s no charge.
0	172.0		TRUMP	All of a sudden, the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out.
0	173.0		TRUMP	And then you have this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.
0	174.0		TRUMP	I only say that you have to look at the facts.
0	175.0		TRUMP	The senators are very capable people.
0	176.0		TRUMP	They’re very good people.
0	177.0		TRUMP	I know many of them.
0	178.0		TRUMP	They’re friends of mine.
0	179.0		TRUMP	These are very talented, very good people.
0	180.0		TRUMP	And they’re going to vote.
0	181.0		TRUMP	They’re going to believe what they believe.
0	182.0		TRUMP	I can — when I look at what’s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman — a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually — I think it’s a shame.
0	183.0		TRUMP	Yes, please.
0	184.0		QUESTION	Yes, Mr. President.
0	185.0		QUESTION	My name is Tomás Regalado from Radio and TV Marti.
0	186.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, yesterday at the speech at the U.N., you spoke about how Venezuela’s problem was because of Cuba and the Castros — how they went in there and they brought socialism and communism to Venezuela, and now to Nicaragua as well.
0	187.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, are you going to be more proactive now against Cuba as well?
0	188.0		TRUMP	I’ve been very proactive against Cuba.
0	189.0		TRUMP	I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba.
0	190.0		TRUMP	As you know, President Obama gave them a pass and I didn’t like it.
0	191.0		TRUMP	Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.
0	192.0		TRUMP	I don’t like what he did.
0	193.0		TRUMP	I’ve ended much of it — most of it.
0	194.0		TRUMP	I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba, and I certainly don’t like what’s happening in Venezuela.
0	195.0		TRUMP	Yes, please.
0	196.0		QUESTION	Mr. President.
0	197.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	198.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, just to finish really fast.
0	199.0		QUESTION	You said also that you had a call-to-action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism.
0	200.0		QUESTION	Would you like to be recognized as —
0	201.0		TRUMP	Well, I wouldn’t say that socialism has been working really well around the world, okay.
0	202.0		TRUMP	You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one — your number one — I guess, the one that is most obvious.
0	203.0		TRUMP	But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high.
0	204.0		TRUMP	Please.
0	205.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	206.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	207.0		QUESTION	Thank you very much.
0	208.0		QUESTION	If you don’t mind, after I’m finished, if Weijia, or Hallie, or Vivian, or one of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great.
0	209.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, just to follow up on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh —
0	210.0		TRUMP	What does he mean by that?
0	211.0		TRUMP	Explain.
0	212.0		TRUMP	What does that mean?
0	213.0		QUESTION	I think it would be great if a female reporter —
0	214.0		TRUMP	What does it mean?
0	215.0		TRUMP	No, what does it mean?
0	216.0		QUESTION	I think it would great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue.
0	217.0		QUESTION	So if you don’t mind, I would ask —
0	218.0		TRUMP	I wouldn’t mind that at all.
0	219.0		TRUMP	No.
0	220.0		TRUMP	Wouldn’t mind it at all.
0	221.0		QUESTION	All right.
0	222.0		QUESTION	Well, let me — if I could call on —
0	223.0		TRUMP	Wouldn’t make any difference to me.
0	224.0		QUESTION	All right.
0	225.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	226.0		QUESTION	If I could follow up on John, and John’s question.
0	227.0		QUESTION	Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser?
0	228.0		QUESTION	You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard.
0	229.0		QUESTION	And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser.
0	230.0		QUESTION	Is that because of the many allegations that you’ve had made against you over the years?
0	231.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, I wasn’t happy with Roy Moore.
0	232.0		TRUMP	Let’s get that straight.
0	233.0		TRUMP	But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate —
0	234.0		QUESTION	But you stood by him.
0	235.0		TRUMP	— and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win.
0	236.0		TRUMP	I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him.
0	237.0		TRUMP	As far as women, whether it’s a man or a woman, these are — you know, it can happen the other way.
0	238.0		TRUMP	Allegations can go the other way also.
0	239.0		TRUMP	You understand that.
0	240.0		TRUMP	And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago — in fact, they don’t even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is.
0	241.0		TRUMP	That’s a long time.
0	242.0		TRUMP	And I could pick, as an example — hopefully I won’t have to do it as a replacement because hopefully this is going to go very well on Thursday.
0	243.0		TRUMP	It’s going to go very well on Monday, or Saturday, or Sunday, or whenever they vote.
0	244.0		TRUMP	But I could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also.
0	245.0		QUESTION	But don’t you understand, sir, that many of these —
0	246.0		TRUMP	And I would look at the character —
0	247.0		QUESTION	— many of these accusers —
0	248.0		TRUMP	No, what I have to do —
0	249.0		QUESTION	— are reluctant to come forward.
0	250.0		QUESTION	You’ve raised doubts about these accusers.
0	251.0		QUESTION	Many of them are reluctant to come forward.
0	252.0		TRUMP	I don’t think people are reluctant to come forward.
0	253.0		TRUMP	They’re going to have a chance to speak at a major — they have a major chance to speak.
0	254.0		QUESTION	But you’re saying why (inaudible) —
0	255.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	256.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	257.0		TRUMP	They have a major chance to speak.
0	258.0		TRUMP	And it will be tomorrow, I assume.
0	259.0		TRUMP	We’ve delayed this — meaning the Republican senators, not me.
0	260.0		TRUMP	The Republicans senators have delayed this for weeks now.
0	261.0		TRUMP	They’re giving the women a major chance to speak.
0	262.0		TRUMP	"Now it’s possible I’ll hear that, and I’ll say, ""Hey, I’m changing my mind"""
0	263.0		TRUMP	That is possible.
0	264.0		TRUMP	We want to give them a chance to speak.
0	265.0		TRUMP	And they’re given —
0	266.0		QUESTION	Do you think all three should have a chance — all three should have a chance to speak?
0	267.0		TRUMP	Well, whoever is given a chance.
0	268.0		TRUMP	We’ve delayed it a long time.
0	269.0		TRUMP	But they’re going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case.
0	270.0		TRUMP	And you know what?
0	271.0		TRUMP	I could be persuaded also.
0	272.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	273.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	274.0		TRUMP	Please.
0	275.0		TRUMP	Please, go ahead.
0	276.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	277.0		TRUMP	I would like to go — yes, go ahead.
0	278.0		TRUMP	Please.
0	279.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	280.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	281.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	282.0		QUESTION	And a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that I didn’t quite hear from you, if you would allow me a couple of questions.
0	283.0		QUESTION	First of all, do you think these women — all three of them are liars?
0	284.0		QUESTION	Yes or no?
0	285.0		TRUMP	Have they been what?
0	286.0		QUESTION	Are they liars?
0	287.0		TRUMP	I can’t tell you.
0	288.0		TRUMP	I have to watch tomorrow.
0	289.0		TRUMP	I have to read.
0	290.0		TRUMP	I just heard about one a little while ago.
0	291.0		TRUMP	I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay?
0	292.0		TRUMP	So I can’t tell you whether or not they’re liars until I hear them.
0	293.0		TRUMP	I don’t know what happened today because I’ve been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know — and I chaired the Security Council.
0	294.0		TRUMP	So I don’t know about today’s person that came forward.
0	295.0		TRUMP	I do know about the lawyer.
0	296.0		TRUMP	And you don’t get much worse — bad reputation, too.
0	297.0		TRUMP	Take a look at his past.
0	298.0		TRUMP	So, as far as the other women are concerned, I’m going to see what happens tomorrow.
0	299.0		TRUMP	I’m going to be watching — you know, believe it or not.
0	300.0		TRUMP	I’m going to see what’s said.
0	301.0		TRUMP	It’s possible that they will be convincing.
0	302.0		TRUMP	Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington.
0	303.0		TRUMP	He’s been on — I guess you’d call it the second highest court.
0	304.0		TRUMP	And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well. And those people don’t believe what’s going on.
0	305.0		TRUMP	I can always be convinced.
0	306.0		TRUMP	I have to hear it.
0	307.0		QUESTION	It sounds like what you’re saying is, there is a situation, there is a scenario under which you would withdraw Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination.
0	308.0		QUESTION	Is that correct?
0	309.0		QUESTION	And have you talked about that with him?
0	310.0		TRUMP	If I thought he was — if I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah sure.
0	311.0		QUESTION	And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?
0	312.0		TRUMP	I want to watch.
0	313.0		TRUMP	I want to see.
0	314.0		TRUMP	I hope I can watch.
0	315.0		TRUMP	I’m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch.
0	316.0		TRUMP	"And I’ll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican senators who — look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, ""We have George Washington,"" the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand."
0	317.0		TRUMP	And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know.
0	318.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	319.0		TRUMP	He may have had some, I think, accusations made.
0	320.0		TRUMP	Didn’t he have a couple of things in his past?
0	321.0		TRUMP	George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists.
0	322.0		TRUMP	I mean 100 percent.
0	323.0		TRUMP	One hundred percent.
0	324.0		TRUMP	So it really doesn’t matter from their standpoint.
0	325.0		TRUMP	That’s why when John asked about the FBI — if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI, and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.
0	326.0		TRUMP	Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you’re going to get some votes from the Democrats.
0	327.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	328.0		TRUMP	Because — we all know why — because it’s called politics.
0	329.0		TRUMP	Then you’ll probably get some votes.
0	330.0		TRUMP	Okay, let’s go.
0	331.0		QUESTION	And my final question, sir,
0	332.0		TRUMP	One more question.
0	333.0		QUESTION	Yes.
0	334.0		QUESTION	Just to follow up —
0	335.0		TRUMP	"She stands up: ""I’d like to ask about three questions"""
0	336.0		TRUMP	It’s not really fair to everyone else.
0	337.0		QUESTION	This will be my last one —
0	338.0		TRUMP	Should I let her ask another question?
0	339.0		SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0	340.0		QUESTION	— to follow up on —
0	341.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	342.0		TRUMP	See?
0	343.0		QUESTION	— to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill O’Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh.
0	344.0		QUESTION	They’re all men.
0	345.0		QUESTION	Why is that?
0	346.0		TRUMP	It’s not a benefit of the doubt.
0	347.0		TRUMP	I’ve —
0	348.0		QUESTION	Has there ever been an instance when you’ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?
0	349.0		TRUMP	I’ve known them.
0	350.0		TRUMP	Hallie, I’ve know them for a long time and — a lot of these people.
0	351.0		TRUMP	A lot of people.
0	352.0		TRUMP	And some I’ve been disappointed with.
0	353.0		TRUMP	I have been disappointed with some.
0	354.0		TRUMP	Others, like — you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.
0	355.0		TRUMP	But I’ve known people for a long time.
0	356.0		TRUMP	I never saw them do anything wrong.
0	357.0		TRUMP	I never saw them do anything wrong.
0	358.0		TRUMP	And there are some that probably — I agree.
0	359.0		TRUMP	I can tell you there are some that I — I’ve been watching for a long time.
0	360.0		TRUMP	And in a couple of cases, they weren’t Republicans.
0	361.0		TRUMP	In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.
0	362.0		TRUMP	But I’ve been watching them for a long time.
0	363.0		TRUMP	And I knew for a long time these were not good people.
0	364.0		TRUMP	And they were never brought up.
0	365.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	366.0		TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.
0	367.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	368.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much by the way.
0	369.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	370.0		QUESTION	Thank you very much, Mr. President.
0	371.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	372.0		QUESTION	When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her.
0	373.0		TRUMP	I do.
0	374.0		QUESTION	But —
0	375.0		TRUMP	I wish it could have gone quicker.
0	376.0		QUESTION	Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely her or her parents would have reported it.
0	377.0		QUESTION	And just today, you said, you wouldn’t —
0	378.0		TRUMP	Well, there is a truth.
0	379.0		QUESTION	I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.
0	380.0		QUESTION	So my question is —
0	381.0		TRUMP	It doesn’t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet.
0	382.0		TRUMP	It’s a very tough situation for a woman, there’s no question about it.
0	383.0		TRUMP	And in some cases, they do report it.
0	384.0		TRUMP	Frankly, had they reported it, it would’ve been pretty amazing, wouldn’t it?
0	385.0		TRUMP	But I guess they didn’t, and that’s okay.
0	386.0		TRUMP	I’m not saying they had to report it because it’s a very personal thing.
0	387.0		TRUMP	It’s a very big problem, there’s no question about it.
0	388.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	389.0		QUESTION	But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion —
0	390.0		TRUMP	I’d like to hear her story, yeah.
0	391.0		TRUMP	Well, we’re giving her a time.
0	392.0		QUESTION	— or have you already made up your mind?
0	393.0		TRUMP	They would’ve given her time last week.
0	394.0		TRUMP	This is the United States Senate.
0	395.0		TRUMP	This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far.
0	396.0		TRUMP	I’ve actually heard it’s the most important decision a President can make.
0	397.0		TRUMP	I disagree with that.
0	398.0		TRUMP	"War and peace — I always say, ""War and peace"""
0	399.0		TRUMP	And after that, Supreme Court Justice.
0	400.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	401.0		TRUMP	I look forward to hearing from her.
0	402.0		TRUMP	We could’ve heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time.
0	403.0		TRUMP	It’ll be interesting to hear what she has to say.
0	404.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	405.0		QUESTION	And let me follow up on Jim’s question.
0	406.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, let me follow up on Jim’s question that I don’t think we got an answer to.
0	407.0		TRUMP	Which one?
0	408.0		TRUMP	Which question?
0	409.0		TRUMP	Who?
0	410.0		QUESTION	How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct —
0	411.0		TRUMP	I’ve been accused.
0	412.0		TRUMP	I’ve been accused.
0	413.0		TRUMP	False accusations.
0	414.0		QUESTION	— right, how have those —
0	415.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	416.0		TRUMP	I’ve been accused.
0	417.0		TRUMP	And I was accused by — I believe, it was — four women.
0	418.0		TRUMP	You can check with Sean Hannity.
1	419.0		TRUMP	You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid.
0	420.0		QUESTION	And how has (inaudible) —
0	421.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	422.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
1	423.0		TRUMP	I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.
0	424.0		TRUMP	We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television.
0	425.0		TRUMP	They refused to even write about it.
0	426.0		TRUMP	There were four women, and maybe more — I think the number is four or five.
1	427.0		TRUMP	But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.
0	428.0		TRUMP	Another one had other things happen.
0	429.0		TRUMP	And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me — and she is the one that reported it.
0	430.0		TRUMP	This woman is incredible.
0	431.0		TRUMP	She reported it, instead of taking the money.
0	432.0		TRUMP	So I’ve had numerous accusations about me.
0	433.0		QUESTION	Right.
0	434.0		TRUMP	I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false.
0	435.0		TRUMP	I never met them.
0	436.0		TRUMP	I never met these people.
0	437.0		TRUMP	And, what did they do?
0	438.0		TRUMP	What did they do?
1	439.0		TRUMP	They took money in order to say bad things.
0	440.0		TRUMP	I’ve had stories written in the New York Times — front page — about four women.
0	441.0		TRUMP	The whole top center front page of the New York Times.
0	442.0		TRUMP	I think it was four big pictures.
0	443.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Wow. That’s a big thing. What’s that?"""
0	444.0		TRUMP	These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me.
0	445.0		TRUMP	Not the worst things about me, but bad things.
0	446.0		TRUMP	"And I said, ""Gee, that’s too bad"""
0	447.0		TRUMP	I knew them a long time ago — 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
0	448.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""That’s too bad. I’m surprised at them."""
0	449.0		TRUMP	And then all of a sudden I see them on television — nothing to do with me.
0	450.0		TRUMP	The next day or a day later, they were incensed.
0	451.0		TRUMP	"They said, ""Donald Trump is a nice guy. We never said this. The New York Times did false reporting. They’re fake news"""
0	452.0		TRUMP	And you know what?
0	453.0		TRUMP	The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.
0	454.0		TRUMP	These women said great things. Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me.
0	455.0		TRUMP	Front page.
0	456.0		TRUMP	And those women — they’re incredible women — they went on television — and they didn’t want to, and I didn’t ask them.
0	457.0		TRUMP	"And they said, ""The New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes"""
0	458.0		TRUMP	And they went on a lot of shows.
0	459.0		TRUMP	They were really incensed and they couldn’t believe it.
0	460.0		TRUMP	That’s why people know that a lot of the news is fake.
0	461.0		TRUMP	And a lot of the people sitting here are fake.
0	462.0		TRUMP	But 20 percent of them are wonderful.
0	463.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	464.0		QUESTION	If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump.
0	465.0		QUESTION	I — you didn’t let me ask my question.
0	466.0		TRUMP	You’ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?
0	467.0		QUESTION	No, you interrupted my question.
0	468.0		TRUMP	Please sit down. Please.
0	469.0		QUESTION	I’m asking you —
0	470.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	471.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	472.0		QUESTION	— how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?
0	473.0		TRUMP	Well, it does impact my opinion.
0	474.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	475.0		TRUMP	Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me.
0	476.0		TRUMP	I’m a very famous person, unfortunately.
0	477.0		TRUMP	I’ve been a famous person for a long time.
0	478.0		TRUMP	But I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me — really false charges.
0	479.0		TRUMP	I know friends that have had false charges.
0	480.0		TRUMP	People want fame.
0	481.0		TRUMP	They want money.
0	482.0		TRUMP	They want whatever.
0	483.0		TRUMP	"So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, ""Oh, Judge Kavanaugh…"" this or that."
0	484.0		TRUMP	It’s happened to me many times.
0	485.0		TRUMP	I’ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane.
0	486.0		TRUMP	And I have a number-one bestseller out?
0	487.0		TRUMP	I mean it was total phony story.
0	488.0		TRUMP	There are many of them.
0	489.0		TRUMP	So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh?
0	490.0		TRUMP	Absolutely.
0	491.0		TRUMP	Because I’ve had it many times.
0	492.0		TRUMP	And if the news would have reported these four people — I couldn’t believe it.
0	493.0		TRUMP	"When I heard that they caught these four people, I said, ""Wow. That’s a big story"""
0	494.0		TRUMP	And it was — for Fox.
0	495.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	496.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	497.0		QUESTION	Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government.
0	498.0		QUESTION	You suggested that the Chinese —
0	499.0		TRUMP	I did.
0	500.0		QUESTION	— had meddled in or are meddling in —
0	501.0		TRUMP	That’s right.
0	502.0		TRUMP	That’s what I hear.
0	503.0		QUESTION	— the 2018 midterm elections.
0	504.0		TRUMP	That’s what I hear.
0	505.0		QUESTION	What evidence do you have of that, sir?
0	506.0		QUESTION	Is there a national intelligence estimate, for example, that you’re prepared to put forward?
0	507.0		TRUMP	We have evidence.
0	508.0		TRUMP	We have evidence.
0	509.0		TRUMP	It’ll come out.
0	510.0		TRUMP	Yeah, I can’t tell you now, but it came — it didn’t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you.
0	511.0		TRUMP	Now, if you — they’ve actually admitted that they’re going after farmers.
0	512.0		TRUMP	I mean, I think most of you can cover that.
0	513.0		TRUMP	"I like that you’re shaking your head, ""yes"""
0	514.0		TRUMP	I’m going to ask you the next question because of that. Okay?
0	515.0		TRUMP	It’s probably going to be the killer of all questions.
0	516.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	517.0		TRUMP	But let me just explain —
0	518.0		QUESTION	But why make the charges now —
0	519.0		TRUMP	No, no, no.
0	520.0		TRUMP	Let me —
0	521.0		QUESTION	— if you’re not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?
0	522.0		TRUMP	China, now, put on $250 billion, and they’re paying 25 percent on that.
0	523.0		TRUMP	They’re paying billions and billions.
0	524.0		TRUMP	This has never happened to China.
0	525.0		TRUMP	And I like China.
0	526.0		TRUMP	And I like President Xi a lot.
0	527.0		TRUMP	I think he’s a friend of mine.
0	528.0		TRUMP	He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he — I think he probably respects —
0	529.0		TRUMP	From what I hear — if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China — he was on a good show — I won’t mention the name of the show — recently.
0	530.0		TRUMP	And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump’s very, very large brain.
0	531.0		TRUMP	"He said, ""Donald. Donald Trump. They don’t know what to do"""
0	532.0		TRUMP	It never happened.
0	533.0		TRUMP	Well, one thing they are trying to do is they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump.
1	534.0		TRUMP	Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.
0	535.0		TRUMP	I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge.
0	536.0		TRUMP	They’re building things that we don’t build anymore.
0	537.0		TRUMP	But we’re starting to build them again.
0	538.0		TRUMP	And our economy now is hotter than it’s ever been. I don’t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.
0	539.0		TRUMP	Fantastic.
0	540.0		TRUMP	And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they’re raising rates because we’ve never done like we’re doing now.
0	541.0		TRUMP	And one of the things that is nice about the rates — the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know —
0	542.0		TRUMP	When President Obama had an economy that was — it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that — you’ve all heard that.
0	543.0		TRUMP	But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money.
0	544.0		TRUMP	He was playing with funny money.
0	545.0		TRUMP	That’s easy.
0	546.0		TRUMP	I’m playing with fairly expensive money.
0	547.0		TRUMP	So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually — in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank.
0	548.0		TRUMP	Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank.
0	549.0		TRUMP	They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.
0	550.0		TRUMP	Now, those people are starting to get interest.
0	551.0		TRUMP	And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to — you know, they did a great job.
0	552.0		TRUMP	The people that did it right, the people that did the best job got hurt the most.
0	553.0		TRUMP	So in one sense I like it, but basically I’m a low-interest-rate person.
0	554.0		TRUMP	I hate to tell you.
0	555.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	556.0		TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.
0	557.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	558.0		TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
0	559.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein.
0	560.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	561.0		QUESTION	Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?
0	562.0		TRUMP	I’m talking to him.
0	563.0		TRUMP	We’ve had a good talk.
0	564.0		TRUMP	He said he never said it.
0	565.0		TRUMP	He said he doesn’t believe it.
0	566.0		TRUMP	He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and we’ll see.
0	567.0		TRUMP	And he’s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it’s the Justice Department.
0	568.0		TRUMP	I would certainly prefer not doing that.
0	569.0		TRUMP	There was no collusion.
0	570.0		TRUMP	There was no obstruction — I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back.
0	571.0		TRUMP	I do fight back.
0	572.0		TRUMP	I really fight back.
0	573.0		TRUMP	I mean, if you call that obstruction, that’s fine.
0	574.0		TRUMP	But there’s no obstruction.
0	575.0		TRUMP	There’s no collusion.
0	576.0		TRUMP	I’m going to meet with him tomorrow.
0	577.0		TRUMP	I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick.
0	578.0		TRUMP	So I don’t want it competing and hurting the decision — one way or the other decision.
0	579.0		TRUMP	Again, I want to hear what she has to say.
0	580.0		TRUMP	But I want to do — so I may delay that.
0	581.0		TRUMP	I’m going to see.
0	582.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to do anything that’s going to conflict with that.
0	583.0		TRUMP	But my preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up.
0	584.0		TRUMP	"You know, I call it a ""witch hunt"""
0	585.0		TRUMP	And it is a witch hunt.
0	586.0		TRUMP	If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page.
0	587.0		TRUMP	If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI.
1	588.0		TRUMP	If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.
0	589.0		TRUMP	And he’s in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run — she lost — to run.
0	590.0		TRUMP	I mean, what’s going on?
0	591.0		TRUMP	"If you look at the horrible statements, like ""Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper"""
0	592.0		TRUMP	Essentially, now we’ll go and investigate that group.
0	593.0		TRUMP	It’s terrible.
0	594.0		TRUMP	We have caught people doing things that are terrible.
0	595.0		TRUMP	I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein.
0	596.0		TRUMP	Much prefer.
0	597.0		TRUMP	Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him.
0	598.0		TRUMP	He said he did not say it.
0	599.0		TRUMP	He said he does not believe that.
0	600.0		TRUMP	And nobody in this room believes it.
0	601.0		TRUMP	By the way, I deal with the people in this room.
0	602.0		TRUMP	I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan.
0	603.0		TRUMP	And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood.
0	604.0		TRUMP	And I said them a long time ago, and I was right.
0	605.0		TRUMP	"He said, ""That’s not the 25th Amendment that I’m looking at"""
0	606.0		TRUMP	I think I can say that from Mike.
0	607.0		QUESTION	So you don’t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed using the 25th Amendment against you?
0	608.0		TRUMP	I don’t think so.
0	609.0		TRUMP	Well, yeah — enemies, sure.
0	610.0		TRUMP	You use anything you can.
0	611.0		QUESTION	Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?
0	612.0		TRUMP	Hey, you use anything they can.
0	613.0		TRUMP	They’re not in love with me.
0	614.0		TRUMP	They’re not going to beat me in the election; they know that.
0	615.0		TRUMP	They’re not going to beat me.
0	616.0		TRUMP	The people that I’m looking at are total lightweights.
0	617.0		TRUMP	I dream of running against those people.
0	618.0		QUESTION	But within your administration?
0	619.0		TRUMP	Maybe they’ll come up with somebody that’s not — they’re not going to beat me.
0	620.0		TRUMP	I’m against what they want to do.
0	621.0		TRUMP	I’m in favor of law enforcement.
0	622.0		TRUMP	I’m in favor of safety and security, and low taxes.
0	623.0		TRUMP	I want low taxes.
0	624.0		TRUMP	I want borders.
1	625.0		TRUMP	We’re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.
0	626.0		TRUMP	I want borders.
1	627.0		TRUMP	We’ve spent $3.2 [billion] and we’re getting another $1.6 [billion].
0	628.0		TRUMP	And then eventually, we’re getting the whole thing and we’ll complete the wall.
0	629.0		TRUMP	They don’t want that.
0	630.0		TRUMP	They don’t want that.
0	631.0		TRUMP	They don’t want the things that I have.
0	632.0		TRUMP	Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats.
0	633.0		TRUMP	They’ll say things and then wink at me.
0	634.0		TRUMP	And again, it’s the same old story.
0	635.0		TRUMP	They’ll say things; they don’t mean it.
0	636.0		TRUMP	Its politics.
0	637.0		TRUMP	The reason they don’t want me is because they want to run the show.
0	638.0		TRUMP	They want it.
0	639.0		TRUMP	It’s power.
0	640.0		TRUMP	It’s whatever you want to call it.
0	641.0		TRUMP	But what they’ve done here is a disgrace.
0	642.0		TRUMP	A total disgrace.
0	643.0		TRUMP	"And what they do — I know, it’s sort of interesting — in one case, they say, ""He’s a fascist. He’s taking over the government. He’s the most powerful President ever. He’s a horrible human being. He wants to take over the entire government, and he’s going to do it. We can’t stop him"""
0	644.0		TRUMP	That didn’t work.
0	645.0		TRUMP	"The next week, he said, ""Uh, he’s incompetent"""
0	646.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Well, wait a minute"""
0	647.0		TRUMP	In one case, I’m taking over the world.
0	648.0		TRUMP	"And in the other case, ""He’s incompetent"""
0	649.0		TRUMP	They tried that for a week.
0	650.0		TRUMP	That didn’t work.
0	651.0		TRUMP	Look, these are very dishonest people.
0	652.0		TRUMP	These are con artists.
0	653.0		TRUMP	And the press knows it, but the press doesn’t write it.
0	654.0		TRUMP	Wow.
0	655.0		TRUMP	That’s a lot of hands.
0	656.0		TRUMP	That’s a lot of — oh, Steve, go ahead.
0	657.0		TRUMP	He is a very high quality person, this man.
0	658.0		TRUMP	But he’ll probably hit me with a bad one.
0	659.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	660.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	661.0		QUESTION	Why —
0	662.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	663.0		TRUMP	Give it to me.
0	664.0		TRUMP	Give it to me, Steve.
0	665.0		TRUMP	Reuters.
0	666.0		QUESTION	You’re getting letters from Chairman Kim.
0	667.0		QUESTION	Why do you need a second summit with the North Korean leader so soon?
0	668.0		QUESTION	And what do you —
0	669.0		TRUMP	Because he’d like it.
0	670.0		QUESTION	What would it be for?
0	671.0		TRUMP	So I’ve received two letters from Chairman Kim.
0	672.0		TRUMP	At some point, I’ll, you know, give these letters — they’re incredible letters.
0	673.0		TRUMP	They’re letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done.
0	674.0		TRUMP	I really believe he wants to get it done.
0	675.0		TRUMP	I may be wrong.
0	676.0		TRUMP	"I heard somebody on a certain network last night — I won’t mention which one — say, ""Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?"""
0	677.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Wait a minute"""
0	678.0		TRUMP	"I asked Sarah Huckabee, ""Please call this person"""
0	679.0		TRUMP	I gave nothing — other than I met.
0	680.0		TRUMP	What did I give them?
0	681.0		TRUMP	I didn’t do what Obama did:  Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages.
0	682.0		TRUMP	I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything.
0	683.0		TRUMP	I haven’t paid them 10 cents.
0	684.0		TRUMP	But he wants to make a deal and I’d like to make a deal.
0	685.0		TRUMP	We actually have a very good relationship together — a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations.
0	686.0		TRUMP	That was a little bit rough.
0	687.0		TRUMP	"Don’t forget, that time, they said, ""Oh, Trump is saying these horrible things. He’s going to get us into a war"""
0	688.0		TRUMP	You were going to have a war.
0	689.0		TRUMP	If I wasn’t elected, you’d be in war.
0	690.0		TRUMP	And President Obama essentially said the same thing.
0	691.0		TRUMP	He was ready to go to war.
0	692.0		TRUMP	You would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands.
0	693.0		TRUMP	You would have lost millions of people.
0	694.0		TRUMP	Seoul has 30 million people — 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border.
0	695.0		TRUMP	If I wasn’t elected, you would have had a war.
0	696.0		TRUMP	President Obama thought you had to go to war.
0	697.0		TRUMP	You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war?
0	698.0		TRUMP	Millions of people.
0	699.0		TRUMP	With me, nobody is talking about that.
0	700.0		TRUMP	Nobody is talking about that.
0	701.0		TRUMP	We have a very good relationship.
0	702.0		TRUMP	He likes me.
0	703.0		TRUMP	I like him.
0	704.0		TRUMP	We get along.
0	705.0		TRUMP	He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters.
0	706.0		TRUMP	"When I showed one of the letters — just one — to Prime Minister Abe, he said, ""This is actually a groundbreaking letter. This is an incredible — this is a historic letter"""
0	707.0		TRUMP	And it is a historic letter.
0	708.0		TRUMP	It’s a beautiful — it’s a beautiful piece of art.
0	709.0		TRUMP	And I think we’re going to make a deal.
0	710.0		TRUMP	Will we make a deal, Steve?
0	711.0		TRUMP	I don’t really know.
0	712.0		TRUMP	But I think we’re going to.
0	713.0		TRUMP	In the meantime — and I’ve said it a thousand — I don’t want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests — you know, for over a year, where you haven’t seen.
0	714.0		TRUMP	Before I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war.
0	715.0		TRUMP	"And then what happened — it was funny — they said, ""He was terrible. He was so rough with Chairman Kim — Kim Jong Un. He was so rough. It’s terrible. He’s going to cause…"""
0	716.0		TRUMP	Well, I had a great meeting with President Putin.
0	717.0		TRUMP	"And on that one, they said, ""He was too soft with President Putin"""
0	718.0		TRUMP	I had a great meeting with the President.
0	719.0		TRUMP	It lasted for two hours.
0	720.0		TRUMP	We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israel’s protection.
0	721.0		TRUMP	We had a great meeting.
0	722.0		TRUMP	They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.
0	723.0		TRUMP	And you know what?
0	724.0		TRUMP	"If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, ""He was too tough"""
0	725.0		TRUMP	You can’t win with these people, but you just keep going.
0	726.0		TRUMP	In the meantime, we’re doing well.
0	727.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	728.0		QUESTION	So how do you — how long do you —
0	729.0		TRUMP	Wait.
0	730.0		TRUMP	One second.
0	731.0		QUESTION	How long do you think it should take North Korea to denuclearize?
0	732.0		TRUMP	I don’t know.
0	733.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to get into —
0	734.0		QUESTION	We’ve seen estimates of one year, two year —
0	735.0		TRUMP	Steve, I don’t want to get into the time game.
0	736.0		TRUMP	You know why?
0	737.0		TRUMP	"I told Mike Pompeo, I said, ""Mike, don’t get into the time game"""
0	738.0		TRUMP	We stopped them.
0	739.0		TRUMP	They’re taking down plants.
0	740.0		TRUMP	They’re taking down a lot of different testing areas.
0	741.0		TRUMP	They’re going to take down some more.
0	742.0		TRUMP	You’ll be hearing about that very soon.
0	743.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to go ahead of myself, but you’ll be hearing about it soon.
0	744.0		TRUMP	They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.
0	745.0		TRUMP	You know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office — you all remember it — where there was a massive — they thought it was an earthquake.
0	746.0		TRUMP	A mountain moved over an inch and a half.
0	747.0		TRUMP	We’re talking about mountains.
0	748.0		TRUMP	You know, North Korea is very mountainous.
0	749.0		TRUMP	Beautiful land.
0	750.0		TRUMP	Beautiful.
0	751.0		TRUMP	This mountain actually shifted.
0	752.0		TRUMP	It shifted.
0	753.0		TRUMP	And somebody thought it was an earthquake.
0	754.0		TRUMP	And then they found out, no, this was nuclear testing.
0	755.0		TRUMP	Shifted a mountain.
0	756.0		TRUMP	Now I’m talking about serious stuff.
0	757.0		TRUMP	Serious size.
0	758.0		TRUMP	When I came in, and certainly before I came in — and even at the beginning of mine because when I was having rhetorical contests — you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it — with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at.
0	759.0		TRUMP	But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.
0	760.0		TRUMP	We’ve had — many Presidents were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea.
0	761.0		TRUMP	We now have a good relationship.
0	762.0		TRUMP	We have a good relationship.
0	763.0		TRUMP	And most importantly, all of the things that you’ve been hearing about –the horror stories — in my opinion, they’re gone.
0	764.0		TRUMP	Now, could they start up again?
0	765.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	766.0		TRUMP	I’m a deal guy.
0	767.0		TRUMP	Could they start?
0	768.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	769.0		TRUMP	Could be that we don’t work it out.
0	770.0		TRUMP	I think — I have it right here — I think that what we’ve done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about — and I don’t blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters.
0	771.0		TRUMP	But saying they want to get it done.
0	772.0		TRUMP	We know much more than the media for a change.
0	773.0		TRUMP	Much more.
0	774.0		TRUMP	But if you saw what’s going on behind the scenes, I think you’d very impressed.
0	775.0		TRUMP	We were a country going to war.
0	776.0		TRUMP	I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said it’s by far his biggest problem.
0	777.0		TRUMP	When I sat with him, prior to going to office — going into office, he said to me that’s by far the biggest problem.
0	778.0		TRUMP	And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.
0	779.0		TRUMP	"And millions of people — not — you know, I — they say, ""Oh, thousands of people…"""
0	780.0		TRUMP	No, no, no, not thousands.
0	781.0		TRUMP	Millions of people would have been killed.
0	782.0		TRUMP	And that could have left — you’re right next to China.
0	783.0		TRUMP	You’re right — that could have been a world war very easily.
0	784.0		TRUMP	Right now, we’re in a great position.
0	785.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to play the time game.
0	786.0		TRUMP	"I told Mike Pompeo, ""Don’t let them do that to you"""
0	787.0		TRUMP	I haven’t given anything.
0	788.0		TRUMP	And all of a sudden — we got back, it was a few weeks ago.
0	789.0		TRUMP	I think we were back like two and a half months from the summit, which was a great success.
0	790.0		TRUMP	"And people are screaming, ""What’s taking so long?"""
0	791.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Oh, I get it"""
0	792.0		TRUMP	You got to understand the media.
0	793.0		TRUMP	I’ve been dealing with the media all my life.
0	794.0		TRUMP	Too much.
0	795.0		TRUMP	Too much.
0	796.0		TRUMP	They’re screaming and I saw that.
0	797.0		TRUMP	"And our guys were — and not Mike — but our guys were being, ""Oh well, we’re working as fast…"""
0	798.0		TRUMP	" I said, ""I got all the time in the world. I don’t have to rush it"""
0	799.0		TRUMP	There’s no — you know, secession of sanctions.
0	800.0		TRUMP	We got the sanctions on.
0	801.0		TRUMP	I didn’t take any sanctions off.
0	802.0		TRUMP	I did see a reporter last night — a guy I like, personally, a lot.
0	803.0		TRUMP	And he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea.
0	804.0		TRUMP	"He said, ""Why did the President give so much?"""
0	805.0		TRUMP	I didn’t give anything.
0	806.0		TRUMP	I gave nothing.
0	807.0		TRUMP	What have I given, other than some time?
0	808.0		TRUMP	Yes, I flew to Singapore.
0	809.0		TRUMP	We had a meeting.
0	810.0		TRUMP	Now, giving would be if I took the sanctions off.
0	811.0		TRUMP	"I didn’t want to do — if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, ""Why don’t we stop these ridiculous,"" in my opinion, ""the military games?"""
0	812.0		TRUMP	"I call them the ""military games"""
0	813.0		TRUMP	"If I told you how much those games cost — and, frankly, I told South Korea, ""You should be paying for these games"""
0	814.0		TRUMP	We pay for them.
0	815.0		TRUMP	"They say, ""Well, we fly the planes in from a short distance away"""
0	816.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Where is that?"""
0	817.0		TRUMP	Guam
0	818.0		TRUMP	Oh, huh.
0	819.0		TRUMP	How long a trip is that?
0	820.0		TRUMP	Seven hours
0	821.0		TRUMP	Oh, great
0	822.0		TRUMP	We’re flying these massive bombers and everything.
0	823.0		TRUMP	I’ve wanted to stop this for a long time.
0	824.0		TRUMP	I consider that an asset.
0	825.0		TRUMP	But we’ve done — we’re saving, by the way — just for the taxpayer, we’re saving a fortune.
0	826.0		TRUMP	And if we need them, we can start them up immediately.
0	827.0		TRUMP	If I think we need them, I’ll start them before the generals will start them.
0	828.0		TRUMP	The fact is, this reporter said that.
0	829.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""What have we done? I haven’t given anything"""
0	830.0		TRUMP	And we’re really onto the cusp.
0	831.0		TRUMP	I think we’re really going to do something that’s going to be very important.
0	832.0		TRUMP	But we’re not playing the time game.
0	833.0		TRUMP	If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.
0	834.0		TRUMP	There’s no nuclear testing and there’s no testing of rockets.
0	835.0		TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.
0	836.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	837.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	838.0		TRUMP	Please.
0	839.0		QUESTION	Thank you.
0	840.0		TRUMP	This is the one that was nodding with every nice thing I said, so watch this question.
0	841.0		QUESTION	It’s a habit of mine.
0	842.0		QUESTION	Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
0	843.0		TRUMP	You’re with who?
0	844.0		QUESTION	Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
0	845.0		TRUMP	Okay, good.
0	846.0		TRUMP	Sky News.
0	847.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	848.0		TRUMP	Congratulations on the purchase.
0	849.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	850.0		QUESTION	Nothing to do with me.
0	851.0		TRUMP	I hope you benefited.
0	852.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	853.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	854.0		QUESTION	"Are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending — being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like ""con job"" in relation to allegations of sexual assault?"
0	855.0		TRUMP	"Oh, I’ve used much worse language in my life than ""con job"""
0	856.0		TRUMP	That’s like probably the nicest phrase I’ve ever used.
0	857.0		TRUMP	I mean, con job — it is.
0	858.0		TRUMP	It’s a con job.
0	859.0		TRUMP	You know, confidence — it’s a confidence job.
0	860.0		TRUMP	But they short — it’s a con job by the Democrats.
0	861.0		TRUMP	They know it.
0	862.0		QUESTION	What about the message that’s being sent to women who are watching?
0	863.0		TRUMP	They did the same thing with the Russia investigation.
0	864.0		TRUMP	They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia.
0	865.0		TRUMP	There was no collusion.
0	866.0		TRUMP	Think of it.
0	867.0		TRUMP	I’m in Wisconsin.
0	868.0		TRUMP	I’m in Michigan.
0	869.0		TRUMP	"I say, ""Gee, we’re not doing well"""
0	870.0		TRUMP	I won both those states.
0	871.0		TRUMP	We’re not doing well.
0	872.0		TRUMP	Uh, let me call the Russians to help
0	873.0		TRUMP	Does anybody really believe that?
0	874.0		TRUMP	It’s a con job.
0	875.0		TRUMP	And I watch these guys — Little Adam Schiff, and all of the guys.
0	876.0		TRUMP	He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker.
0	877.0		TRUMP	You know, he was a comedian or something.
0	878.0		TRUMP	This is so-and-so calling for… — he took the call.
0	879.0		TRUMP	Why is the taking a call from a Russian?
0	880.0		TRUMP	Senator Warner took a call from a Russian.
0	881.0		TRUMP	"He was a comedian or something, but he said, ""We have pictures of President Trump"""
0	882.0		TRUMP	Oh, where can I get them?  If we ever did that, it would be like a big deal.
0	883.0		TRUMP	Yeah, it’s a con job.
0	884.0		TRUMP	And it’s not a bad term.
0	885.0		TRUMP	It’s not a bad term at all.
0	886.0		QUESTION	Are you worried —
0	887.0		TRUMP	I’ll tell you one thing I can say: I’ve had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to what’s happening, because it’s a horrible precedent.
0	888.0		TRUMP	I’m going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly.
0	889.0		TRUMP	I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two.
0	890.0		TRUMP	And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh — spoke to him and his family — and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored.
0	891.0		TRUMP	It was as though — I mean, the biggest thing that’s ever happened.
0	892.0		TRUMP	And I understand that — U.S. Supreme Court.
0	893.0		TRUMP	"I don’t want to be in a position where people say, ""No, thanks. No, thanks. I don’t want to"""
0	894.0		TRUMP	"You know, ""I spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good"""
0	895.0		TRUMP	We have a country to run.
0	896.0		TRUMP	We want the best talent in the world.
0	897.0		TRUMP	But I’ll tell you this:  The people that have complained to me about it the most — about what’s happening — are women.
0	898.0		TRUMP	Women are very angry.
0	899.0		TRUMP	You know, I got 52 percent with women.
0	900.0		TRUMP	"Everyone said, ""This couldn’t happen — 52 percent"""
0	901.0		TRUMP	Women are so angry.
0	902.0		TRUMP	And I, frankly, think that — I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster.
0	903.0		TRUMP	But give them their day in court.
0	904.0		TRUMP	Let her have her day in court.
0	905.0		TRUMP	Let somebody else have a day in court.
0	906.0		TRUMP	But the ones that I find — I mean, I have men that don’t like it, but I have women that are incensed at what’s going on.
0	907.0		TRUMP	I’ve always said women are smarter than men.
0	908.0		TRUMP	I’ve said that a lot and I mean it.
0	909.0		TRUMP	But women are incensed at what’s going on.
0	910.0		TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
0	911.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	912.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	913.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, in the back.
0	914.0		QUESTION	Sorry.
0	915.0		QUESTION	It’s me?
0	916.0		TRUMP	Who are you?
0	917.0		TRUMP	Or where are you from?
0	918.0		QUESTION	It’s me?
0	919.0		QUESTION	It’s me?
0	920.0		TRUMP	Yeah, you.
0	921.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	922.0		TRUMP	The guy looks — guy looks like he’s shocked.
0	923.0		TRUMP	That’s not — this is going to be not good.
0	924.0		QUESTION	It’s going to be good, sir.
0	925.0		TRUMP	The guy looks totally like stunned that I — have you ever been picked before for a question?
0	926.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	927.0		QUESTION	Yes, sir, but not from President of the United States.
0	928.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	929.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	930.0		TRUMP	Give me a question.
0	931.0		QUESTION	Thank you very much.
0	932.0		QUESTION	My name is Majeed Gly from Rudaw Media Network.
0	933.0		QUESTION	I want to, sir, ask you — you always talk about —
0	934.0		TRUMP	Excuse me, you said where?
0	935.0		TRUMP	From where?
0	936.0		QUESTION	Rudaw Media Network from Kurdistan region, north of Iraq.
0	937.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	938.0		QUESTION	I’m a Kurd.
0	939.0		QUESTION	Sir —
0	940.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	941.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	942.0		TRUMP	Great people.
0	943.0		QUESTION	Thank you, sir.
0	944.0		TRUMP	Great people.
0	945.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	946.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	947.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	948.0		QUESTION	Mr. President.
0	949.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, I want to —
0	950.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	951.0		TRUMP	Are you a Kurd?
0	952.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	953.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	954.0		QUESTION	Mr. President —
0	955.0		TRUMP	They’re great people.
0	956.0		TRUMP	They’re great fighters.
0	957.0		TRUMP	I like them a lot.
0	958.0		TRUMP	Let’s go.
0	959.0		TRUMP	I like this question so far.
0	960.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, you always say you support your allies.
0	961.0		QUESTION	Kurds right now, after the defeat of ISIS, are under a lot of pressure in Syria and in Iraq by many adversaries.
0	962.0		TRUMP	It’s true.
0	963.0		QUESTION	What will you do to elevate their position to support them in order — after they help the United States to defeat ISIS?
0	964.0		QUESTION	Thank you very much.
0	965.0		TRUMP	Well, we are helping them a lot and we’ve been very friendly with them.
0	966.0		TRUMP	And, as you know, we’ve fought side-by-side.
0	967.0		TRUMP	And we have defeated ISIS, essentially, a very short while ago, in the Middle East.
0	968.0		TRUMP	And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds.
0	969.0		TRUMP	And they are — they’re great fighters.
0	970.0		TRUMP	You know, some people are great fighters and some people aren’t.
0	971.0		TRUMP	The Kurds are great fighters.
0	972.0		TRUMP	And they’re great, great people.
0	973.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to be working — we’re discussing that situation exactly right now.
0	974.0		QUESTION	What will you do to support them, sir, (inaudible) Syria?
0	975.0		TRUMP	Well, I’m just telling you, we’re going to be discussing that situation.
0	976.0		TRUMP	We have already started discussing that situation.
0	977.0		TRUMP	But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS.
0	978.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	979.0		QUESTION	And about Syria:  Sir, in your speech you did not mention —
0	980.0		TRUMP	Uh, yes.
0	981.0		TRUMP	Go.
0	982.0		TRUMP	Uh oh.
0	983.0		QUESTION	Here we go.
0	984.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	985.0		TRUMP	You don’t need it.
0	986.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, Susan Li from Fox Business.
0	987.0		QUESTION	Did you reject a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau?
0	988.0		TRUMP	Yeah, I did.
0	989.0		QUESTION	Why?
0	990.0		TRUMP	"Because his tariffs are too high, and he doesn’t seem to want to move, and I’ve told him, ""Forget about it"""
0	991.0		TRUMP	And frankly, we’re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada.
0	992.0		TRUMP	That’s the motherlode.
0	993.0		TRUMP	That’s the big one.
0	994.0		TRUMP	We’re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.
0	995.0		TRUMP	We don’t like their representative very much.
0	996.0		TRUMP	They’ve taken advantage — I love Canada, by the way.
0	997.0		TRUMP	I have so many friends.
0	998.0		TRUMP	I have everybody, and so many friends.
0	999.0		TRUMP	But that has nothing to do with this; I’m representing the United States.
0	1000.0		TRUMP	Mexico was totally — I mean, they were great.
0	1001.0		TRUMP	By the way, the new President has been great.
0	1002.0		TRUMP	The deal is done.
0	1003.0		TRUMP	Now, it has to go through Congress and, you know, a lot things have to happen.
0	1004.0		TRUMP	But we’ve done — Bob Lighthizer, who’s here someplace.
0	1005.0		TRUMP	Where’s Bob?
0	1006.0		TRUMP	Bob.
0	1007.0		TRUMP	Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have.
0	1008.0		TRUMP	But the deal is done.
0	1009.0		TRUMP	It’s up to Congress.
0	1010.0		QUESTION	And, Mr. President —
0	1011.0		TRUMP	But Canada has treated us very badly.
0	1012.0		TRUMP	They’ve treated our farmers in Wisconsin, and New York state, and a lot of other states very badly.
1	1013.0		TRUMP	Dairy products — 300 percent.
1	1014.0		TRUMP	Three hundred percent.
0	1015.0		TRUMP	How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent?
0	1016.0		TRUMP	The answer is:  You don’t.
0	1017.0		TRUMP	What it is, is a barrier.
1	1018.0		TRUMP	"It’s — basically, they’re saying, ""We don’t have any barriers. By the way, it’s 300 percent"""
0	1019.0		TRUMP	So you don’t send it in, because you can’t compete.
0	1020.0		TRUMP	So Canada has a long way to go.
0	1021.0		TRUMP	I must be honest with you, we’re not getting along at all with their negotiators.
0	1022.0		TRUMP	We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.
0	1023.0		TRUMP	We had people that didn’t know what they were doing.
0	1024.0		TRUMP	And that’s why we had — over the last five or six years, if you average it out, we had $800 billion a year in trade losses.
0	1025.0		TRUMP	It’s ridiculous.
0	1026.0		TRUMP	It’s not going to happen.
0	1027.0		QUESTION	What about NAFTA?
0	1028.0		QUESTION	Sir, Mr. President, NAFTA —
0	1029.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1030.0		QUESTION	What does that mean for NAFTA?
0	1031.0		QUESTION	Will you be pulling out of NAFTA?
0	1032.0		TRUMP	I don’t like NAFTA.
0	1033.0		TRUMP	I never liked it.
0	1034.0		TRUMP	It’s been very bad for the United States.
0	1035.0		TRUMP	It’s been great for Canada.
0	1036.0		TRUMP	It’s been great for Mexico.
0	1037.0		TRUMP	Very bad for us.
0	1038.0		QUESTION	But will you pull out of the —
0	1039.0		TRUMP	"I’m not going to use the name ""NAFTA"""
0	1040.0		TRUMP	I refuse to use it.
0	1041.0		TRUMP	I’ve seen thousands of plants and factories close.
0	1042.0		TRUMP	I’ve seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved.
0	1043.0		TRUMP	I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA.
0	1044.0		TRUMP	Under our deal, it’s not going to happen anymore.
0	1045.0		TRUMP	I hate to tell you, it’s not.
0	1046.0		TRUMP	We’re going to keep companies.
0	1047.0		TRUMP	"And I told the Mexicans, I said, ""We have to keep companies"""
0	1048.0		TRUMP	But they’re getting a lot, also.
0	1049.0		TRUMP	They’re getting other things.
0	1050.0		TRUMP	They’re getting a lot of good things.
0	1051.0		TRUMP	Mexico made a very good deal.
0	1052.0		TRUMP	But with Canada, it’s very tough.
0	1053.0		TRUMP	What we’re doing is if we made a deal with Canada — which is, you know, a good chance still.
0	1054.0		TRUMP	But I’m not making anything near what they want to do.
0	1055.0		TRUMP	We’re going to be fair.
0	1056.0		QUESTION	But you’re — are you going to notify Congress of pulling out of NAFTA?
0	1057.0		TRUMP	"What we’re probably going to do is call it the ""USMC"""
0	1058.0		TRUMP	Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love.
0	1059.0		TRUMP	General Kelly likes it even more.
0	1060.0		TRUMP	Where’s General Kelly?
0	1061.0		TRUMP	He likes that.
0	1062.0		TRUMP	USMC — which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada.
0	1063.0		TRUMP	"But it’ll probably or possibly be just ""USM"""
0	1064.0		TRUMP	It’ll be United States and Mexico.
0	1065.0		QUESTION	Yes or no, are you going to —
0	1066.0		TRUMP	Canada will come along.
0	1067.0		TRUMP	Now, if Canada doesn’t make a deal with us, we’re going to make a much better deal.
0	1068.0		TRUMP	We’re going to tax the cars that come in.
0	1069.0		TRUMP	We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury.
0	1070.0		TRUMP	And frankly, we’ll be very happy because it’s actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal.
0	1071.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	1072.0		TRUMP	Good job, too.
0	1073.0		TRUMP	You do a very good job.
0	1074.0		TRUMP	Really good.
0	1075.0		TRUMP	Yes, please.
0	1076.0		TRUMP	Mr. Kurd.
0	1077.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	1078.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1079.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	1080.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1081.0		QUESTION	Thank you very much for your time, Mr. President.
0	1082.0		QUESTION	Two, quickly, questions:  What will be the U.S.A. relations with the Kurds —
0	1083.0		TRUMP	Oh, I thought I just answered that.
0	1084.0		QUESTION	— post-ISIS.
0	1085.0		QUESTION	Post-ISIS.
0	1086.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1087.0		TRUMP	We’re trying to get along very well.
0	1088.0		TRUMP	We do get along great with the Kurds.
0	1089.0		TRUMP	We’re trying to help them a lot.
0	1090.0		TRUMP	Don’t forget, that’s their territory.
0	1091.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
0	1092.0		TRUMP	We have to help them.
0	1093.0		TRUMP	I want to help them.
0	1094.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, what’s next?
0	1095.0		QUESTION	Then, what —
0	1096.0		TRUMP	They fought with us.
0	1097.0		TRUMP	They fought with us.
0	1098.0		TRUMP	They died with us.
0	1099.0		TRUMP	They died.
0	1100.0		TRUMP	We lost — tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS.
0	1101.0		TRUMP	They died for us and with us.
0	1102.0		TRUMP	And for themselves.
0	1103.0		TRUMP	They died for themselves.
0	1104.0		TRUMP	But they’re great people.
0	1105.0		TRUMP	And we have not forget — we don’t forget — I don’t forget.
0	1106.0		TRUMP	What happens someday later — but I can tell you that I don’t forget.
0	1107.0		TRUMP	These are great people.
0	1108.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1109.0		TRUMP	Yes, ma’am.
0	1110.0		TRUMP	Please.
0	1111.0		TRUMP	Please —
0	1112.0		QUESTION	About Iran, Mr. President.
0	1113.0		QUESTION	About Iran, one question: What is your clear plan to stop Iranian influence in Iraq, in Syria, and especially in Iraqi Kurdistan?
0	1114.0		TRUMP	Well, I think you’ve seen that.
0	1115.0		TRUMP	I must tell you, it’s — I don’t mind your question because —
0	1116.0		QUESTION	Raheem Rashidi, from Kurdistan TV.
0	1117.0		QUESTION	Thank you.
0	1118.0		TRUMP	I think there’s been no greater change — other than maybe China, because China — unfortunately, their markets have dropped — would you say, 30 percent in the last four months, right?
0	1119.0		TRUMP	I think I watched you recently when you said that.
0	1120.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""I think she’s wrong. I think it’s actually 32. But that’s okay"""
0	1121.0		TRUMP	But a lot.
0	1122.0		TRUMP	There’s been no — other than maybe that, but even that.
0	1123.0		TRUMP	Because China is a very special place.
0	1124.0		TRUMP	And Iran is a very special place.
0	1125.0		TRUMP	But I think there’s been no country that’s changed so much as Iran.
0	1126.0		TRUMP	In the last six months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it — one of the dumbest deals ever made.
0	1127.0		TRUMP	As an example, why didn’t they take care of Yemen in the deal?
0	1128.0		TRUMP	Why didn’t they take care of Syria in the deal?
0	1129.0		TRUMP	You know what Kerry said — the reason?
0	1130.0		TRUMP	It was too complicated.
0	1131.0		TRUMP	We’re giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash — cash.
0	1132.0		TRUMP	This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills.
0	1133.0		TRUMP	And you’d need probably five rooms like this.
0	1134.0		TRUMP	But you have $1.8 billion in cash.
0	1135.0		TRUMP	Why didn’t we take care of Yemen?
0	1136.0		TRUMP	Why didn’t we take care of Syria and other?
0	1137.0		TRUMP	"And he said, ""Because it was too complicated"""
0	1138.0		TRUMP	Well, you just gave all your cards.
0	1139.0		TRUMP	You gave them $150 billion.
0	1140.0		TRUMP	And now Yemen’s a mess, but it’s getting better.
0	1141.0		TRUMP	And Syria’s a mess.
0	1142.0		TRUMP	And I was responsible — and I hope it stays that way — when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province.
0	1143.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Don’t do it"""
0	1144.0		TRUMP	"And I’ll tell you, it happened — where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up and she said, ""There’s a province in Syria with 3 million people. Right now, the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province. And they’re going to kill my sister. And they’re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs"""
0	1145.0		TRUMP	But I think we can call them terrorists.
0	1146.0		TRUMP	"And I said, ""That’s not going to happen"""
0	1147.0		TRUMP	I didn’t hear of Idlib Province.
0	1148.0		TRUMP	And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times — I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times.
0	1149.0		TRUMP	And I opened it up — not on the front page, but there was a very big story.
0	1150.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Wow, that’s the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe"""
0	1151.0		TRUMP	Because why would — how would anyone do that with 3 million people?
0	1152.0		TRUMP	And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting — literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists.
0	1153.0		TRUMP	"And I put out on social media and elsewhere — I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: ""Don’t let it happen"""
0	1154.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Don’t let it happen"""
0	1155.0		TRUMP	That doesn’t mean they can’t be selective.
0	1156.0		TRUMP	They can’t be — you know, go in and they’ve got to do what they’ve got to do with terrorists.
0	1157.0		TRUMP	I assume they’re terrorists.
0	1158.0		TRUMP	But don’t kill millions of people.
0	1159.0		TRUMP	And it stopped.
0	1160.0		TRUMP	You saw that.
0	1161.0		TRUMP	Nobody’s going to give me credit, but that’s okay.
0	1162.0		TRUMP	That’s okay.
0	1163.0		TRUMP	Because the people the people know.
0	1164.0		TRUMP	I have had more Syrians thank me for that.
0	1165.0		TRUMP	This was about four weeks ago, I put that out.
0	1166.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""They’re surrounding a city of 3 million people. They’re going to start bombing the city. Don’t let it happen"""
0	1167.0		TRUMP	And I meant it, too.
0	1168.0		TRUMP	I meant it.
0	1169.0		TRUMP	And millions of people have been saved.
0	1170.0		TRUMP	And I gave, today, great credit to Iran.
0	1171.0		TRUMP	I don’t know if you heard that.
0	1172.0		TRUMP	I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it.
0	1173.0		TRUMP	Now I hope it’s going to be surgical — meaning go in and do — it’s lengthy and everything else.
0	1174.0		TRUMP	And they possibly have to do it.
0	1175.0		TRUMP	But I think millions of people would have been killed.
0	1176.0		TRUMP	And that would have been a shame.
0	1177.0		TRUMP	And hopefully — and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help.
0	1178.0		TRUMP	Turkey has been great.
0	1179.0		TRUMP	Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.
0	1180.0		QUESTION	Mr. President.
0	1181.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	1182.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	1183.0		QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
0	1184.0		TRUMP	Good.
0	1185.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	1186.0		QUESTION	Touching back on Iran: Of course, this week, you put out a call to action to other countries to rally with America, to put pressure on Iran.
0	1187.0		QUESTION	Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal.
0	1188.0		QUESTION	But after meeting with world leaders this week, did you make any progress towards a potential new deal?
0	1189.0		TRUMP	Doesn’t matter what world leaders think on Iran.
0	1190.0		TRUMP	Iran’s going to come back to me and they’re going to make a good deal, I think.
0	1191.0		TRUMP	Maybe not.
0	1192.0		TRUMP	Deals — you never know.
0	1193.0		TRUMP	But they’re suffering greatly.
1	1194.0		TRUMP	They’re having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama.
0	1195.0		TRUMP	Far greater.
1	1196.0		TRUMP	When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people.
0	1197.0		TRUMP	You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that.
0	1198.0		TRUMP	But I’m sticking up for the people.
0	1199.0		TRUMP	I am with the people of Iran.
0	1200.0		TRUMP	But here’s the thing:  They have rampant inflation.
0	1201.0		TRUMP	Their money is worthless.
0	1202.0		TRUMP	Everything is going wrong.
0	1203.0		TRUMP	They have riots in the street.
0	1204.0		TRUMP	You can’t buy bread.
0	1205.0		TRUMP	You can’t do anything.
0	1206.0		TRUMP	It’s a disaster.
0	1207.0		TRUMP	"At some point, I think they’re going to want to come back, and they’re going to say, ""Hey, can we do something?"""
0	1208.0		TRUMP	And I’m very simple; I just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.
0	1209.0		TRUMP	That’s all.
0	1210.0		TRUMP	Is that too much to ask?
0	1211.0		TRUMP	I don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.
0	1212.0		TRUMP	I want them to have a great economy.
0	1213.0		TRUMP	I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices — I’m not happy with OPEC.
0	1214.0		TRUMP	"I told them, ""I’m not happy with OPEC"""
0	1215.0		TRUMP	We take care of all these people, we defend them.
0	1216.0		TRUMP	They wouldn’t be there for two weeks if it wasn’t for me, and the United States, and a much stronger armed forces than it was.
0	1217.0		TRUMP	Because our armed forces was depleted.
0	1218.0		TRUMP	We had old equipment.
0	1219.0		TRUMP	Now, we have — hey, you know better than anybody — $700 billion and $716 billion.
0	1220.0		TRUMP	We have the most incredible new jets and everything.
0	1221.0		TRUMP	We need it.
0	1222.0		TRUMP	Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs.
0	1223.0		TRUMP	It’s all made in the United States.
0	1224.0		TRUMP	But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk.
0	1225.0		TRUMP	And I’m not doing this from strength or weakness.
0	1226.0		TRUMP	I’m just saying, at some point, I think they’re going to have to come back.
0	1227.0		TRUMP	If you look at what’s going on, companies are leaving left and right.
0	1228.0		TRUMP	Mercedes Benz just left.
0	1229.0		TRUMP	They’re all leaving.
0	1230.0		TRUMP	They don’t want to be in Iran.
0	1231.0		TRUMP	Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?
0	1232.0		TRUMP	And we have, by — we picked up $10 trillion since my election.
0	1233.0		TRUMP	We were being caught by China.
0	1234.0		TRUMP	Now it’s going the other way.
0	1235.0		TRUMP	People can’t believe it.
0	1236.0		TRUMP	People have never seen this situation with China.
0	1237.0		TRUMP	"Everything’s always been — for 20 years, ""Oh, China is so great. China is so great"""
0	1238.0		TRUMP	You don’t hear that so much anymore.
0	1239.0		TRUMP	I love China; I think they’re great.
0	1240.0		TRUMP	But you don’t hear that so much anymore.
0	1241.0		TRUMP	You know who’s great now?
0	1242.0		TRUMP	We’re great now.
0	1243.0		TRUMP	Okay, how about just a couple more.
0	1244.0		TRUMP	Now, I could be doing — I could be doing this all day long.
0	1245.0		TRUMP	I could be doing this all day long.
0	1246.0		TRUMP	Should we continue for a little while?
0	1247.0		TRUMP	It doesn’t matter to me.
0	1248.0		TRUMP	A couple of more.
0	1249.0		TRUMP	I don’t care.
0	1250.0		TRUMP	New York Times, come on.
0	1251.0		TRUMP	New York Times.
0	1252.0		TRUMP	The failing New York Times.
0	1253.0		TRUMP	Stand up.
0	1254.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1255.0		QUESTION	You’re talking about me, but (inaudible).
0	1256.0		TRUMP	No, I’m talking about the Times is failing.
0	1257.0		TRUMP	You are far from failing.
0	1258.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1259.0		QUESTION	Okay, but you’re not — you were pointing to me, so you meant me.
0	1260.0		QUESTION	But I —
0	1261.0		TRUMP	The Times are very interesting, though.
0	1262.0		TRUMP	The Times, I think they’re going to endorse me.
0	1263.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1264.0		TRUMP	I think that ABC — I think — well, Fox — I like Fox.
0	1265.0		TRUMP	I really do.
0	1266.0		QUESTION	Just to be sure —
0	1267.0		TRUMP	But I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, the — they’re all going to endorse me, because if they don’t, they’re going out of business.
0	1268.0		TRUMP	Can you imagine if you didn’t have me?
0	1269.0		TRUMP	Go ahead, what would you like to say?
0	1270.0		QUESTION	Just to be sure, I know you were pointing to me, but I work for PBS NewsHour.
0	1271.0		TRUMP	I know that.
0	1272.0		TRUMP	No, I know that.
0	1273.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1274.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1275.0		TRUMP	So, I want to ask you: Yesterday, you were talking about your administration’s accomplishments at the United Nations, and a lot of the leaders laughed.
0	1276.0		TRUMP	Why do you think they were laughing?
0	1277.0		TRUMP	Well, that’s fake news.
0	1278.0		QUESTION	And what was that experience like for you?
0	1279.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	1280.0		TRUMP	It was fake news.
0	1281.0		TRUMP	And it was covered that way.
0	1282.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1283.0		TRUMP	So, I said that, since my election, our economy has become the hottest in the world.
0	1284.0		TRUMP	Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years — really, soon to be historic.
0	1285.0		TRUMP	Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country.
0	1286.0		TRUMP	You look at Black unemployment.
0	1287.0		TRUMP	You look at Asian unemployment.
0	1288.0		TRUMP	You look at women — 65 years.
0	1289.0		TRUMP	The unemployment numbers are among the best we’ve ever had ever.
0	1290.0		TRUMP	The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.
0	1291.0		TRUMP	And I said this.
0	1292.0		TRUMP	And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations — people that aren’t big into clapping, applauding, smiling.
0	1293.0		TRUMP	And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before.
0	1294.0		TRUMP	It’s true.
0	1295.0		TRUMP	I mean, it is true.
0	1296.0		TRUMP	And I heard a little rustle.
0	1297.0		TRUMP	"And I said, ""It’s true"""
0	1298.0		TRUMP	And I heard smiles.
0	1299.0		TRUMP	"And I said, ""Oh, I didn’t know there there’d be that kind…"""
0	1300.0		TRUMP	They weren’t laughing at me.
0	1301.0		TRUMP	They were laughing with me.
0	1302.0		TRUMP	We had fun.
0	1303.0		TRUMP	That was not laughing at me.
0	1304.0		TRUMP	"So the fake news said, ""People laughed at President Trump"""
0	1305.0		TRUMP	They didn’t laugh at me.
0	1306.0		TRUMP	People had a good time with me.
0	1307.0		TRUMP	We were doing it together.
0	1308.0		TRUMP	We had a good time.
0	1309.0		TRUMP	They respect what I’ve done.
0	1310.0		TRUMP	The United States is respected again.
0	1311.0		TRUMP	The United States was not respected.
0	1312.0		TRUMP	Everybody was taking advantage of us.
0	1313.0		TRUMP	From jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price — to so many other things, even military protection.
0	1314.0		TRUMP	"I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said, ""Listen, you’re a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems. You would have real problems."""
0	1315.0		QUESTION	And I — I want to —
0	1316.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""You should reimburse us for this protection. Why are we protecting you?"""
0	1317.0		TRUMP	And do you want to know what they said after about two minutes of talking?
0	1318.0		TRUMP	They agreed with me.
0	1319.0		TRUMP	And you can ask this group of very talented people — they agreed with me.
0	1320.0		TRUMP	"But they said — one of them said, ""But Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that. They never asked us for that"""
0	1321.0		TRUMP	"Nobody has ever said, ""You should pay"""
0	1322.0		TRUMP	These are really wealthy countries.
0	1323.0		TRUMP	I mean, I’ll be honest, I just asked Japan.
0	1324.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""We’re defending you. You’re a very wealthy country. You’re sending us millions of cars. We have a tremendous trade deficit with you. And we’re defending you, and we’re subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money."""
0	1325.0		TRUMP	I said it to South Korea.
0	1326.0		TRUMP	We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.
0	1327.0		TRUMP	They’re a very wealthy — these are great countries.
0	1328.0		TRUMP	These are very wealthy countries.
0	1329.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Why aren’t you reimbursing us for our costs?"""
0	1330.0		TRUMP	And you know what?
0	1331.0		TRUMP	They look at me, and they can’t even answer it, because there’s no answer.
0	1332.0		TRUMP	If they’re a poor country and they needed protection, and people were going to die, I’m all for protecting them; I don’t want 10 cents.
0	1333.0		TRUMP	But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us — massive — and then on top of that, we’re paying for their military?
0	1334.0		TRUMP	Or we’re paying for a lot of their military?
0	1335.0		TRUMP	That doesn’t work.
0	1336.0		TRUMP	How about two more, and we’ll call it?
0	1337.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, really quickly.
0	1338.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, you said you feel a kinship — you said you feel a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh and you — Mr. President, really quickly, you said you felt a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh.
0	1339.0		QUESTION	You said that you also — your false allegations that you feel like were made against you make you feel like you don’t want to believe these women.
0	1340.0		QUESTION	What message do you think that —
0	1341.0		TRUMP	No, I didn’t say that.
0	1342.0		TRUMP	Why do you say that?
0	1343.0		QUESTION	So, please explain —
0	1344.0		TRUMP	Fake news.
0	1345.0		QUESTION	Please explain —
0	1346.0		TRUMP	Why — did I say that?
0	1347.0		QUESTION	Well, can you please explain then what you’re talking about in your own false allegations?
0	1348.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	1349.0		TRUMP	And by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didn’t say that.
0	1350.0		TRUMP	I do watch you.
0	1351.0		TRUMP	And I think you do a very good job.
0	1352.0		TRUMP	But I didn’t say that.
0	1353.0		QUESTION	So could you explain what you meant?
0	1354.0		TRUMP	"I said, exactly, ""I look forward to watching her"""
0	1355.0		TRUMP	I do want to hear what she says.
0	1356.0		TRUMP	And maybe she’ll say — I could be convinced of anything.
0	1357.0		TRUMP	Maybe, if she’ll say something — but in the meantime, I have to tell you, he’s one of the highest quality human beings.
0	1358.0		TRUMP	He’s a tremendous man.
0	1359.0		TRUMP	He’s a tremendous genius.
0	1360.0		TRUMP	He’s a great intellect.
0	1361.0		TRUMP	He was, I believe, number one at Yale.
0	1362.0		TRUMP	Is that a correct statement?
0	1363.0		TRUMP	Number one in his class at Yale.
0	1364.0		QUESTION	So you don’t feel a kinship with him?
0	1365.0		TRUMP	He was a great student in law.
0	1366.0		TRUMP	He was — you know, I’ve heard his name.
0	1367.0		TRUMP	I didn’t know him.
0	1368.0		TRUMP	Didn’t know him.
0	1369.0		TRUMP	Until this whole thing, I didn’t know him.
0	1370.0		TRUMP	But I heard his name for 10 years.
0	1371.0		TRUMP	And you know how I heard his name?
0	1372.0		TRUMP	Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court.
0	1373.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Who is he?"""
0	1374.0		TRUMP	His name is Brett Kavanaugh. And he should be — he’s the most brilliant person. He’s the most brilliant lawyer
0	1375.0		TRUMP	They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago.
0	1376.0		TRUMP	With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say.
0	1377.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	1378.0		QUESTION	But you said that you don’t feel — but you said that you feel like there have been numerous false allegations against you, and that because of that–
0	1379.0		TRUMP	Oh, I’ve had many false —
0	1380.0		QUESTION	— you feel that you understand what he might be going through.
0	1381.0		TRUMP	I’ve had many false statements against me.
0	1382.0		TRUMP	And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy.
0	1383.0		TRUMP	I think John Roberts would tell you that — you covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me.
0	1384.0		TRUMP	Sean Hannity covered it.
0	1385.0		TRUMP	I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him.
0	1386.0		TRUMP	Believe it or not, I don’t speak to him very much, but I respect him.
0	1387.0		TRUMP	I called him.
0	1388.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""This is the biggest story. This is a big, big story"""
0	1389.0		TRUMP	He agreed with me.
0	1390.0		TRUMP	The next day, I picked up the papers.
0	1391.0		TRUMP	There wasn’t one word about it.
0	1392.0		TRUMP	The next day, I watched ABC news.
0	1393.0		TRUMP	John, I watched NBC.
0	1394.0		TRUMP	I watched CBS.
0	1395.0		TRUMP	I didn’t watch CNN, but, next time, I’m going to.
0	1396.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1397.0		QUESTION	And are you okay with —
0	1398.0		TRUMP	I watched everything.
0	1399.0		TRUMP	There wasn’t one story other than Fox.
0	1400.0		TRUMP	And it’s a big story.
0	1401.0		TRUMP	It’s a shame.
0	1402.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1403.0		TRUMP	Enough.
0	1404.0		TRUMP	Thank you, though.
0	1405.0		QUESTION	And is it okay if I give it to the New York Times?
0	1406.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1407.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1408.0		QUESTION	Is it okay if I give it to the New York Times, Mr. President?
0	1409.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1410.0		TRUMP	That’s enough, please.
0	1411.0		QUESTION	I’m just going to — okay.
0	1412.0		TRUMP	Good job.
0	1413.0		TRUMP	Good job.
0	1414.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, could I ask a question, since I am from the New York Times —
0	1415.0		QUESTION	Mr. President —
0	1416.0		QUESTION	— before this gentleman?
0	1417.0		TRUMP	Since you’re where?
0	1418.0		TRUMP	Since you’re where?
0	1419.0		QUESTION	I’m actually from the New York Times.
0	1420.0		QUESTION	Yamiche is my former colleague, and we miss her.
0	1421.0		QUESTION	But I was hoping I could ask a question.
0	1422.0		TRUMP	I don’t blame you.
0	1423.0		TRUMP	But I’ll let you do it after he does it.
0	1424.0		TRUMP	Is that okay?
0	1425.0		QUESTION	That’s perfectly well.
0	1426.0		TRUMP	I will do that in honor of a paper I once loved.
0	1427.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1428.0		QUESTION	Thank you.
0	1429.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1430.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, my name is Edward Szall, with TruNews.
0	1431.0		QUESTION	Today, you met with Bibi Netanyahu, from Israel.
0	1432.0		QUESTION	And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there.
0	1433.0		TRUMP	I do.
0	1434.0		QUESTION	Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal (inaudible) —
0	1435.0		TRUMP	Well, I’d love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.
0	1436.0		TRUMP	You know, my whole life, I was told that’s the toughest deal.
0	1437.0		TRUMP	And I disagree.
0	1438.0		TRUMP	I think healthcare is probably tougher, okay?
0	1439.0		TRUMP	You want to know the truth.
0	1440.0		TRUMP	But it is tough.
0	1441.0		TRUMP	But we’re going to take care of that, too.
0	1442.0		TRUMP	And that’s going to get taken care of.
0	1443.0		TRUMP	We’ve already taken care of a lot of it.
0	1444.0		TRUMP	But the whole — my life, I’ve always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that’s like the toughest deal.
0	1445.0		TRUMP	Every possible thing is tough about that.
0	1446.0		TRUMP	I think we’re going to make a deal.
0	1447.0		TRUMP	I think we’re going to make a deal.
0	1448.0		TRUMP	So, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for.
0	1449.0		TRUMP	A man who has been extremely nice to me — very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the embassy, which, by the way, we’re going to open in four months for less than $500,000.
0	1450.0		TRUMP	And the budget was over $1 billion, right?
0	1451.0		QUESTION	Yes.
0	1452.0		QUESTION	That’s correct.
0	1453.0		TRUMP	So we saved, let’s say, a billion dollars.
0	1454.0		TRUMP	That’s not so bad.
0	1455.0		TRUMP	And it’s open.
0	1456.0		TRUMP	And it’s beautiful, by the way.
0	1457.0		TRUMP	Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones.
0	1458.0		TRUMP	"I will tell you, the question — somebody said today, ""Well, this is the first news conference in a long time"""
0	1459.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""What do you mean? I did like, five today"""
0	1460.0		TRUMP	Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room — meaning, reporters.
0	1461.0		TRUMP	And one of the reporters — I won’t say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse.
0	1462.0		TRUMP	But one of the — it was, but that’s okay.
0	1463.0		TRUMP	Don’t feel guilty, John.
0	1464.0		TRUMP	But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state.
0	1465.0		TRUMP	"And I said, ""I think the two-state will happen. I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything."""
0	1466.0		TRUMP	I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything.
0	1467.0		TRUMP	It’s actually a little tougher deal.
0	1468.0		TRUMP	But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves.
0	1469.0		TRUMP	So, they asked be about that.
0	1470.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Well, I think the two-state will happen. I think we’re going to go down the two-state road"""
0	1471.0		TRUMP	And I’m glad I got it out.
0	1472.0		TRUMP	And Jared, who is so involved — he loves Israel.
0	1473.0		TRUMP	He loves Israel.
0	1474.0		TRUMP	But he’s also going to be very fair with the Palestinians.
0	1475.0		TRUMP	He understands it takes two people to be happy — two groups of people to be happy.
0	1476.0		TRUMP	Everybody has got to be happy.
0	1477.0		TRUMP	And that’s why it’s so tough, because there’s been so much hatred and anger for so many years.
0	1478.0		TRUMP	That’s what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is.
0	1479.0		TRUMP	But they asked me — I said I think it’s going to be a two-state.
0	1480.0		TRUMP	And you know what I did today?
0	1481.0		TRUMP	By saying that, I put it out there.
0	1482.0		TRUMP	And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that.
0	1483.0		TRUMP	But nobody wanted to say it.
0	1484.0		TRUMP	It’s a big thing to put it out.
0	1485.0		TRUMP	It’s a very big thing to put it out.
0	1486.0		TRUMP	Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that’s okay with me.
0	1487.0		TRUMP	If they want two states, that’s okay with me.
0	1488.0		TRUMP	I’m happy if they’re happy.
0	1489.0		TRUMP	I’m a facilitator.
0	1490.0		TRUMP	I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people don’t get killed anymore.
0	1491.0		TRUMP	When we had — in Saudi Arabia, we had one of the great conferences in history.
0	1492.0		TRUMP	Many of you were there; probably all of you were there.
0	1493.0		TRUMP	It was one of the most beautiful two days.
0	1494.0		TRUMP	That, and China — two of the most incredible events I’ve ever seen.
0	1495.0		TRUMP	I’ve never seen anything like it.
0	1496.0		TRUMP	And we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries — the leaders.
0	1497.0		TRUMP	The kings, the emirs, the absolute leaders from every — there was nobody in second place.
0	1498.0		TRUMP	They were the leaders of the whole thing.
0	1499.0		TRUMP	And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually — it wasn’t a setup.
0	1500.0		TRUMP	"They’d come up to me and say, ""Sir, you can’t have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians"""
0	1501.0		TRUMP	"I said, ""Why? What difference? Why does that matter so much?"""
0	1502.0		TRUMP	"They said, ""It just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelis…"""
0	1503.0		TRUMP	So, I heard that from one — the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy — King Salman.
0	1504.0		TRUMP	And then, somebody else came up.
0	1505.0		TRUMP	"And he wasn’t told, ""Oh, go up and say it"""
0	1506.0		TRUMP	I know where they’re coming from.
0	1507.0		TRUMP	And I must have had 12 leaders say it.
0	1508.0		TRUMP	And they just said it.
0	1509.0		TRUMP	And I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing.
0	1510.0		TRUMP	And we’re trying very hard to get it.
0	1511.0		TRUMP	I think, probably, two-state is more likely.
0	1512.0		TRUMP	But you know what?
0	1513.0		TRUMP	If they do a single, if they do a double, I’m okay with it if they’re both happy.
0	1514.0		TRUMP	If they’re both happy, I’m okay with either.
0	1515.0		TRUMP	I think the two-state is more likely.
0	1516.0		TRUMP	Okay, how about one — go ahead.
0	1517.0		QUESTION	New York Times?
0	1518.0		QUESTION	New York Times?
0	1519.0		TRUMP	Oh, okay.
0	1520.0		QUESTION	Thank you, sir.
0	1521.0		TRUMP	I would have gotten bad story in the New York Times.
0	1522.0		TRUMP	But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn’t matter.
0	1523.0		QUESTION	We’re — we’re kind of, uh —
0	1524.0		TRUMP	Okay, we’ll do you after that.
0	1525.0		QUESTION	We’re kind of, uh —
0	1526.0		TRUMP	And then we’ll call it quits.
0	1527.0		QUESTION	We’re kind of thriving, not failing these days.
0	1528.0		TRUMP	You’re doing very well.
0	1529.0		QUESTION	Yeah.
0	1530.0		TRUMP	"Say, ""Thank you, Mr. Trump"""
0	1531.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1532.0		QUESTION	(Laughs).
0	1533.0		QUESTION	I think I’ll stop short of that.
0	1534.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1535.0		TRUMP	I wonder how you do — you know, all my life, I’ve had very few stories — but I’ve had some on the front page of the New York Times.
0	1536.0		TRUMP	Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?
0	1537.0		QUESTION	That is —
0	1538.0		TRUMP	And, of the three or four, they’re all negative.
0	1539.0		TRUMP	No matter what I do, they’re negative.
0	1540.0		TRUMP	But you know what?
0	1541.0		TRUMP	That’s okay.
0	1542.0		TRUMP	I still love the paper.
0	1543.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1544.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1545.0		QUESTION	I wanted to come back to China, because I think what you announced today was really important.
0	1546.0		TRUMP	I agree.
0	1547.0		QUESTION	You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his government —
0	1548.0		TRUMP	That’s right.
0	1549.0		QUESTION	— of interfering in our internal affairs —
0	1550.0		TRUMP	That’s right.
0	1551.0		QUESTION	— subverting our Democratic process, and doing it to hurt you, the Republican Party —
0	1552.0		TRUMP	Doing it to help them.
0	1553.0		QUESTION	— and your backers.
0	1554.0		TRUMP	You know what?
0	1555.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	1556.0		TRUMP	Doing it to help them.
0	1557.0		QUESTION	So how can a guy who does that be your friend?
0	1558.0		TRUMP	I think that we are able to — and maybe he’s not anymore.
0	1559.0		TRUMP	I’ll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship.
0	1560.0		TRUMP	I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other.
0	1561.0		TRUMP	They are doing studies on Donald Trump.
0	1562.0		TRUMP	They’re trying to figure it all out because this has never happened to them before.
0	1563.0		TRUMP	It’s never happened.
0	1564.0		TRUMP	Think of it, you’ve never seen — you’ve covered very well — you’ve never seen this happen.
0	1565.0		TRUMP	They’re having big problems.
0	1566.0		TRUMP	I don’t want them to have problems, but they got to make a fair deal.
0	1567.0		TRUMP	Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.
0	1568.0		TRUMP	I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together.
0	1569.0		TRUMP	And I can tell you that about many leaders.
0	1570.0		TRUMP	I can also tell you a few where I don’t feel I’ll ever have a chemistry with them.
0	1571.0		TRUMP	I don’t want to have a chemistry with them.
0	1572.0		TRUMP	And for those people, I’ll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared.
0	1573.0		TRUMP	I can go — our general; I’ll have our general.
0	1574.0		TRUMP	Or if they can’t do it, I’ll have Sarah Huckabee do it.
0	1575.0		TRUMP	Right?
0	1576.0		TRUMP	But for the most part, I have very good — very good with Prime Minister Abe.
0	1577.0		TRUMP	Very good with President Moon.
0	1578.0		TRUMP	By the way, what President Moon said last night — I know you won’t report it — but Bret Baier interviewed him last night and he asked him about me.
0	1579.0		TRUMP	I can’t say — because you would say I’m too braggadocios — but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing.
0	1580.0		TRUMP	Couldn’t have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump. TRUMP And nobody else could do it
0	1581.0		TRUMP	You know, I mean, you’ll take a look.
0	1582.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you, China is very special.
0	1583.0		TRUMP	Very special.
0	1584.0		TRUMP	They’re incredible people.
0	1585.0		TRUMP	It’s an incredible country.
0	1586.0		TRUMP	What they’ve done is unbelievable.
0	1587.0		QUESTION	How would —
0	1588.0		TRUMP	And it all started with the WTO.
0	1589.0		TRUMP	It was a defective deal.
0	1590.0		TRUMP	And it all started — without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today.
0	1591.0		TRUMP	And then it started also by — our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office — another way of saying it — allowed them to get away with murder.
0	1592.0		TRUMP	Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.
0	1593.0		TRUMP	I think we still probably have a very good relationship.
0	1594.0		TRUMP	But you know what?
0	1595.0		TRUMP	In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him.
0	1596.0		TRUMP	"Say, ""Hey, how you doing?"""
0	1597.0		TRUMP	Okay?
0	1598.0		QUESTION	Can I — can I just ask —
0	1599.0		TRUMP	You don’t mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.
0	1600.0		QUESTION	I just had two small follow-ups.
0	1601.0		QUESTION	One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?
0	1602.0		TRUMP	Well, I think it’s different.
0	1603.0		TRUMP	If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials.
1	1604.0		TRUMP	"Saying about, ""Oh, you got to stop Trump. You got to stop him. You got to vote against him"""
0	1605.0		TRUMP	My farmers are so incredible.
0	1606.0		TRUMP	These are patriots.
0	1607.0		TRUMP	You know, on a network that doesn’t like me very much — which is most of them — but a network that didn’t — doesn’t really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers.
0	1608.0		TRUMP	And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying.
0	1609.0		TRUMP	By the way, they’ve started buying again.
0	1610.0		TRUMP	I don’t know if you’ve noticed.
0	1611.0		TRUMP	And soybeans are going up, and things are going up.
0	1612.0		TRUMP	And we’ve had very little hurt from what I’ve done.
0	1613.0		TRUMP	In fact, the markets have gone up.
0	1614.0		TRUMP	And the farmers are going to do great.
0	1615.0		TRUMP	But, ultimately — but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them.
0	1616.0		TRUMP	And they voted for me and they love me.
0	1617.0		TRUMP	"And they said, ""We don’t care if we get hurt. He’s doing the right thing"""
0	1618.0		TRUMP	And, you know, a lot of people — it’s a complex game.
0	1619.0		TRUMP	A lot of people don’t know exactly what it is.
0	1620.0		TRUMP	"They don’t know how to define ""tariff"""
0	1621.0		TRUMP	They don’t know it is really different than a tax, although it’s getting close.
0	1622.0		TRUMP	But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that’s fighting for them; that’s not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that’s not allowing the kind of abuse that we — I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA.
0	1623.0		TRUMP	And for years — because it was never changed — NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.
0	1624.0		TRUMP	You know why?
1	1625.0		TRUMP	Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.
0	1626.0		TRUMP	And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it.
0	1627.0		TRUMP	So you went many years and they never changed it.
0	1628.0		TRUMP	There was a VAT tax that Mexico got.
0	1629.0		TRUMP	So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started.
0	1630.0		TRUMP	NAFTA was a horrible thing.
0	1631.0		TRUMP	So the farmers and — by the way, the steel workers — you know, I stopped the dumping.
0	1632.0		TRUMP	The dumping was horrible.
0	1633.0		TRUMP	And now if they want to dump, that’s okay, but they’ve got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump.
0	1634.0		TRUMP	That’s okay.
0	1635.0		TRUMP	But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.
0	1636.0		TRUMP	"But the farmers say, ""This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before"""
0	1637.0		TRUMP	And you really have to study what’s happened over the 15 years with the farm.
0	1638.0		TRUMP	The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period.
0	1639.0		TRUMP	They’ve been decimated.
0	1640.0		TRUMP	The farmers are going to come out great.
0	1641.0		TRUMP	These are great people.
0	1642.0		TRUMP	They’re great, great patriots.
0	1643.0		TRUMP	I think we should finish with that one.
0	1644.0		TRUMP	Is that okay?
0	1645.0		TRUMP	(CROSSTALK)
0	1646.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	1647.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1648.0		TRUMP	Let’s go.
0	1649.0		TRUMP	Fast.
0	1650.0		QUESTION	Sure.
0	1651.0		TRUMP	I always like — always like to finish with a good one.
0	1652.0		TRUMP	"Elton John said, ""When you hit that last tune and it’s good, don’t go back"""
0	1653.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1654.0		TRUMP	I’ve seen — have you ever seen?
0	1655.0		TRUMP	They do great.
0	1656.0		TRUMP	They’re great.
0	1657.0		TRUMP	They hit the last tune and everyone goes crazy.
0	1658.0		TRUMP	Then they go back for an encore, right?
0	1659.0		TRUMP	And they don’t hit it.
0	1660.0		TRUMP	And they leave — everyone leaves.
0	1661.0		TRUMP	"They said, ""That wasn’t a very good concert, was it?"""
0	1662.0		TRUMP	Let’s go.
0	1663.0		QUESTION	Well, I’ll ask you one final question —
0	1664.0		TRUMP	You — don’t make me wrong.
0	1665.0		TRUMP	Go ahead.
0	1666.0		QUESTION	— ahead of tomorrow’s hearing.
0	1667.0		QUESTION	Because you were asked earlier in the news conference about Brett —
0	1668.0		TRUMP	Say it again.
0	1669.0		TRUMP	Say it again.
0	1670.0		QUESTION	About the hearing tomorrow.
0	1671.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	1672.0		QUESTION	You were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from Sky News about the message that you are sending to —
0	1673.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	1674.0		QUESTION	— the women of the country.
0	1675.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	1676.0		QUESTION	What about the message that you may be sending to young men?
0	1677.0		QUESTION	You’re a father.
0	1678.0		QUESTION	What does this moment that we’re in — the cultural moment —
0	1679.0		TRUMP	It’s a very big cultural moment.
0	1680.0		QUESTION	Right.
0	1681.0		QUESTION	So what messages do you for young men of America?
0	1682.0		TRUMP	It’s a very big — it’s also — you’re right.
0	1683.0		TRUMP	I think it’s a great question.
0	1684.0		TRUMP	This is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he’s got very strong charges against him — probably charges that nobody is going to be able be — to prove.
0	1685.0		TRUMP	So I could have you chosen for a position.
0	1686.0		TRUMP	I could have you, or you, or you — anybody.
0	1687.0		TRUMP	And somebody could say things.
0	1688.0		TRUMP	And it’s happened to me many times, where false statements are made.
0	1689.0		TRUMP	And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.
0	1690.0		TRUMP	I could pick another Supreme Court judge — Justice.
0	1691.0		TRUMP	I could pick another one.
0	1692.0		TRUMP	Another one.
0	1693.0		TRUMP	Another one.
0	1694.0		TRUMP	This could go on forever.
0	1695.0		TRUMP	"Somebody could come and say, ""Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this. He did that. He did that."""
0	1696.0		TRUMP	And honestly, it’s a very dangerous period in our country.
0	1697.0		TRUMP	And it’s being perpetrated by some very evil people.
0	1698.0		TRUMP	Some of them are Democrats, I must say.
0	1699.0		TRUMP	Because some of them know that this is just a game that they’re playing.
0	1700.0		TRUMP	It’s a con game.
0	1701.0		TRUMP	It’s at the highest level.
0	1702.0		TRUMP	We’re talking about the United States Supreme Court.
0	1703.0		TRUMP	This can go on forever.
0	1704.0		TRUMP	I can pick five other people.
0	1705.0		TRUMP	"At a certain point, the people are going to say, ""No, thank you"""
0	1706.0		TRUMP	This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.
0	1707.0		TRUMP	And you know what?
0	1708.0		TRUMP	I would honestly say — because I interviewed great people for this job.
0	1709.0		TRUMP	He’s great, but I interviewed other great people for this job.
0	1710.0		TRUMP	"I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying, ""It’s too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I’m going to choose you, number two. I want you to go"""
0	1711.0		TRUMP	And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago.
0	1712.0		QUESTION	With respect, sir —
0	1713.0		TRUMP	So this is — this is — and this is beyond Supreme Court.
0	1714.0		QUESTION	Right.
0	1715.0		TRUMP	There’s nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court.
0	1716.0		TRUMP	This has everything to do with our country.
0	1717.0		TRUMP	When you are guilty until proven innocent, it’s just not supposed to be that way.
0	1718.0		TRUMP	"Always I heard, ""You’re innocent until proven guilty"""
0	1719.0		TRUMP	I’ve heard this for so long, and it’s such a beautiful phrase.
0	1720.0		TRUMP	In this case, you’re guilty until proven innocent.
0	1721.0		TRUMP	I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.
0	1722.0		TRUMP	With that being said, I look forward to what she has to say.
0	1723.0		TRUMP	I also look very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say.
0	1724.0		TRUMP	I think it’s going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.
0	1725.0		QUESTION	And —
0	1726.0		TRUMP	I want to thank you all.
0	1727.0		TRUMP	We’ll do it again.
0	1728.0		QUESTION	Sir, the message to young men?
0	1729.0		QUESTION	Sir?
0	1730.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1731.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	1732.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	1733.0		TRUMP	"At a certain point, the people are going to say, “No, thank you.."""
0	1734.0		TRUMP	This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.
0	1735.0		TRUMP	And you know what.
0	1736.0		TRUMP	I would honestly say — because I interviewed great people for this job.
0	1737.0		TRUMP	He’s great, but I interviewed other great people for this job.
0	1738.0		TRUMP	I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying, “It’s too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I’m going to choose you, number two.
0	1739.0		TRUMP	I want you to go..
0	1740.0		TRUMP	And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago.
0	1741.0		QUESTION	With respect, sir —
0	1742.0		TRUMP	So this is — this is — and this is beyond Supreme Court.
0	1743.0		QUESTION	Right.
0	1744.0		TRUMP	There’s nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court.
0	1745.0		TRUMP	This has everything to do with our country.
0	1746.0		TRUMP	When you are guilty until proven innocent, it’s just not supposed to be that way.
0	1747.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	1748.0		TRUMP	I’ve heard this for so long, and it’s such a beautiful phrase.
0	1749.0		TRUMP	In this case, you’re guilty until proven innocent.
0	1750.0		TRUMP	I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.

0	1758.0		QUESTION	Sir?
0	1759.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	1760.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	1761.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
1	1.0		TRUMP	Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.
1	2.0		TRUMP	Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.
1	3.0		TRUMP	As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums.
1	4.0		TRUMP	I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.
1	5.0		TRUMP	I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.
0	6.0		TRUMP	That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare.
1	7.0		TRUMP	Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.
0	8.0		TRUMP	Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.
0	9.0		TRUMP	The Democrats' plan threatens America's seniors.
0	10.0		TRUMP	The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised.
1	11.0		TRUMP	By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.
0	12.0		TRUMP	Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business.
0	13.0		TRUMP	Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors.
0	14.0		TRUMP	There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures.
0	15.0		TRUMP	Previously covered care would effectively be denied.
0	16.0		TRUMP	In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None.
0	17.0		TRUMP	Under the Democrats' plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die.
0	18.0		TRUMP	The Democrats' plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own health care decisions.
0	19.0		TRUMP	Instead, Democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.
0	20.0		TRUMP	My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction.
0	21.0		TRUMP	The first thing the Democratic plan will do to end choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about 20 million seniors as well as eliminate other private health plans that seniors currently use to supplement their Medicare coverage.
0	22.0		TRUMP	Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American’s private and employer-based health plan.
0	23.0		TRUMP	It is right there in their proposed legislation: Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan.
0	24.0		TRUMP	Americans might think that such an extreme, anti-senior, anti-choice and anti-consumer proposal for government-run health care would find little support among Democrats in Congress.
1	25.0		TRUMP	Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation.
0	26.0		TRUMP	Democratic nominees for governor in Florida, California and Maryland are all campaigning in support of it, as are many Democratic congressional candidates.
1	27.0		TRUMP	Democrats want open-borders socialism.
0	28.0		TRUMP	The truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead.
0	29.0		TRUMP	The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America’s economy after Venezuela.
0	30.0		TRUMP	If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America.
0	31.0		TRUMP	Government-run health care is just the beginning.
0	32.0		TRUMP	Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the U.S. economy.
0	33.0		TRUMP	Every single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life.
0	34.0		TRUMP	Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay.
1	35.0		TRUMP	Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
0	36.0		TRUMP	That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.
1	37.0		TRUMP	Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.
0	38.0		TRUMP	This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.
0	39.0		TRUMP	Under its vision, costs will spiral out of control.
0	40.0		TRUMP	Taxes will skyrocket.
0	41.0		TRUMP	And Democrats will seek to slash budgets for seniors’ Medicare, Social Security and defense.
0	42.0		TRUMP	Republicans believe that a Medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved.
0	43.0		TRUMP	I am committed to resolutely defending Medicare and Social Security from the radical socialist plans of the Democrats.
0	44.0		TRUMP	For the sake of our country, our prosperity, our seniors and all Americans — this is a fight we must win.
0	1.0		TRUMP	Okay, thank you very much.
0	2.0		TRUMP	It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.
0	3.0		TRUMP	And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.
0	4.0		TRUMP	Criminal justice reform — as you know, we've just heard word — got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote.
0	5.0		TRUMP	We have great Democrat support, great Republican support.
0	6.0		TRUMP	So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get — how long, Nancy?
0	7.0		TRUMP	Many years.
0	8.0		PELOSI	A long time.
0	9.0		TRUMP	Many, many years.
0	10.0		TRUMP	Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully — famous last words — on a very bipartisan way.
0	11.0		TRUMP	And it's really something we're all very proud of.
0	12.0		TRUMP	And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats.
0	13.0		TRUMP	And I think it's going to get a very good vote.
0	14.0		TRUMP	And we'll see soon enough.
0	15.0		TRUMP	But it will be up for a vote very shortly.
0	16.0		TRUMP	A lot of years they've been waiting for it.
0	17.0		TRUMP	The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely.
0	18.0		TRUMP	And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.
0	19.0		TRUMP	But pretty close.
0	20.0		SCHUMER	Soon.
0	21.0		SCHUMER	Soon.
0	22.0		SYSTEM	(Inaudible.)
0	23.0		TRUMP	And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.
0	24.0		TRUMP	A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of.
0	25.0		TRUMP	And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon.
0	26.0		TRUMP	And then we have the easy one, the wall.
0	27.0		TRUMP	That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.
0	28.0		TRUMP	What do you think, Chuck?
0	29.0		TRUMP	Maybe not?
0	30.0		SCHUMER	"It's called ""funding the government,"" Mr. President."
0	31.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	32.0		TRUMP	So we're going to see.
0	33.0		TRUMP	But I will tell you, the wall will get built.
0	34.0		TRUMP	We'll see what happens.
0	35.0		TRUMP	It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than — I can say — the Republicans.
0	36.0		TRUMP	We have great Republican support.
0	37.0		TRUMP	We don't have Democrat support.
0	38.0		TRUMP	But we're going to talk about that now.
0	39.0		TRUMP	We're going to see.
0	40.0		TRUMP	One thing that I do have to say is:
0	41.0		TRUMP	Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of — a lot of wall.
0	42.0		TRUMP	When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work.
0	43.0		TRUMP	In San Diego, we're building new walls right now.
0	44.0		TRUMP	And we've — right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well.
0	45.0		TRUMP	So, a lot of wall has been built.
0	46.0		TRUMP	We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building — it's being built right now, big sections of wall.
0	47.0		TRUMP	And we will continue that.
0	48.0		TRUMP	And one way or the other, it's going to get built.
0	49.0		TRUMP	I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.
0	50.0		TRUMP	We will see what happens over the next short period of time.
0	51.0		TRUMP	But the wall is a very important thing to us.
0	52.0		TRUMP	I might put it a different way.
0	53.0		TRUMP	Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security.
0	54.0		TRUMP	When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of — we shut it down; we had no choice.
0	55.0		TRUMP	We shut it down.
0	56.0		TRUMP	But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.
0	57.0		TRUMP	I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.
0	58.0		TRUMP	They've been incredible.
0	59.0		TRUMP	The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible.
0	60.0		TRUMP	And very importantly, our military.
0	61.0		TRUMP	Our military went in and they did an incredible job.
0	62.0		TRUMP	They have been really, really spectacular.
0	63.0		TRUMP	A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in — they were going to come in even in a rough way — many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries.
0	64.0		TRUMP	They're leaving.
0	65.0		TRUMP	If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico.
0	66.0		TRUMP	And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well.
0	67.0		TRUMP	So we appreciate that.
0	68.0		TRUMP	But they haven't been coming into our country.
0	69.0		TRUMP	We can't let people come in that way.
0	70.0		TRUMP	So that's pretty much it.
0	71.0		TRUMP	We're going to talk about the wall.
0	72.0		TRUMP	I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is.
0	73.0		TRUMP	I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is.
0	74.0		TRUMP	And I want to talk about the wall.
0	75.0		TRUMP	"And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of — I really think I can say ""border security,"" but certainly the wall."
0	76.0		TRUMP	But the wall will get built.
1	77.0		TRUMP	A lot of the wall is built.
1	78.0		TRUMP	It's been very effective.
0	79.0		TRUMP	I asked for a couple of notes on that.
1	80.0		TRUMP	If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.
1	81.0		TRUMP	El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.
1	82.0		TRUMP	In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.
1	83.0		TRUMP	Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.
0	84.0		TRUMP	"I mean — and when I say ""dropped,"" the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built."
1	85.0		TRUMP	It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.
1	86.0		TRUMP	So, I mean, it's very effective.
0	87.0		TRUMP	If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel — 99.9 percent effective.
0	88.0		TRUMP	And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.
0	89.0		TRUMP	So we've done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built.
0	90.0		TRUMP	A lot of people don't know that.
0	91.0		TRUMP	A lot of wall is renovated.
0	92.0		TRUMP	We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape.
0	93.0		TRUMP	And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military.
0	94.0		TRUMP	Our military has done a fantastic job.
0	95.0		TRUMP	So the wall will get built, but we may not — we may not have an agreement today.
0	96.0		TRUMP	We probably won't.
0	97.0		TRUMP	But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.
0	98.0		TRUMP	Nancy, would you like to say something?
0	99.0		PELOSI	Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people.
0	100.0		PELOSI	I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.
0	101.0		PELOSI	You have the White House —
0	102.0		TRUMP	"Did you say ""Trump"" — oh, oh."
0	103.0		PELOSI	"A ""Trump shutdown."""
0	104.0		PELOSI	You have the White House —
0	105.0		TRUMP	"I was going to call it a ""Pelosi shutdown."""
0	106.0		PELOSI	You have the Senate.
0	107.0		PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.
0	108.0		PELOSI	You have the votes.
0	109.0		PELOSI	You should pass it right now.
0	110.0		TRUMP	No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it.
0	111.0		PELOSI	No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today.
0	112.0		TRUMP	Yeah, but I can't — excuse me.
0	113.0		TRUMP	But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.
0	114.0		TRUMP	I don't want to waste time.
0	115.0		PELOSI	Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.
0	116.0		TRUMP	The House we can get passed very easily, and we do.
0	117.0		PELOSI	Okay, then do it.
0	118.0		PELOSI	Then do it.
0	119.0		TRUMP	But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote.
0	120.0		PELOSI	No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President.
0	121.0		PELOSI	The point is —
0	122.0		TRUMP	It's sort of the point.
0	123.0		PELOSI	— that there are equities to be weighed.
0	124.0		PELOSI	And we are here to have a conversation —
0	125.0		TRUMP	Correct.
0	126.0		PELOSI	— in a careful way.
0	127.0		PELOSI	So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.
0	128.0		PELOSI	But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want.
0	129.0		TRUMP	If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately.
0	130.0		TRUMP	We would get it passed very easily in the House.
0	131.0		PELOSI	No, that's not the point.
0	132.0		PELOSI	That's not the point.
0	133.0		TRUMP	Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.
0	134.0		TRUMP	It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.
0	135.0		TRUMP	That's the problem.
0	136.0		PELOSI	Well, again, let us have our conversation —
0	137.0		TRUMP	That's right.
0	138.0		PELOSI	— and then we can meet with the press again.
0	139.0		PELOSI	But the fact is, is that legislating — which is what we do —
0	140.0		TRUMP	Right.
0	141.0		PELOSI	— you begin, you make your point, you state your case.
0	142.0		PELOSI	That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes.
0	143.0		PELOSI	But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall — no matter where you start.
0	144.0		SCHUMER	That is exactly right.
0	145.0		SCHUMER	You don't have the votes in the House.
0	146.0		TRUMP	If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them — in one session, it would be done.
0	147.0		PELOSI	Well, then go do it.
0	148.0		PELOSI	Go do it.
0	149.0		TRUMP	It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.
0	150.0		PELOSI	No, don't put it on the Senate.
0	151.0		PELOSI	Put it on the negotiation.
0	152.0		TRUMP	Okay, let me ask you this.
0	153.0		TRUMP	Just — and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.
0	154.0		TRUMP	It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans —
0	155.0		PELOSI	You will not win.
0	156.0		TRUMP	It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.
0	157.0		PELOSI	Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President.
0	158.0		TRUMP	I need 10 senators.
0	159.0		TRUMP	That's the problem.
0	160.0		PELOSI	Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.
0	161.0		TRUMP	I have the White House.
0	162.0		PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.
0	163.0		TRUMP	The White House is done.
0	164.0		TRUMP	And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.
0	165.0		TRUMP	But I can't because I need —
0	166.0		PELOSI	But you can't — you can't —
0	167.0		TRUMP	Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.
0	168.0		SCHUMER	All right, let me say something here.
0	169.0		PELOSI	Mr. President, let me — let me just say one thing.
0	170.0		PELOSI	The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.
0	171.0		TRUMP	Nancy, I do.
0	172.0		TRUMP	And we need border security.
0	173.0		PELOSI	Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out.
0	174.0		TRUMP	Nancy.
0	175.0		TRUMP	Nancy.
0	176.0		TRUMP	We need border security.
0	177.0		TRUMP	It's very simple.
0	178.0		PELOSI	Of course we do.
0	179.0		TRUMP	We need border security.
0	180.0		PELOSI	We do.
1	181.0		TRUMP	People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.
0	182.0		TRUMP	We have terrorists.
1	183.0		TRUMP	We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.
0	184.0		TRUMP	Ten.
0	185.0		TRUMP	These are very serious people.
0	186.0		TRUMP	Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done.
1	187.0		TRUMP	But we caught 10 terrorists.
0	188.0		TRUMP	These are people that were looking to do harm.
0	189.0		TRUMP	We need the wall.
0	190.0		TRUMP	We need — more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece.
0	191.0		TRUMP	But it's important.
0	192.0		TRUMP	Chuck, did you want to say something?
0	193.0		SCHUMER	Yeah.
0	194.0		SCHUMER	Here's what I want to say:
0	195.0		SCHUMER	We have a lot of disagreements here.
0	196.0		SCHUMER	The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is — how much of the wall is built and how much is there.
0	197.0		SCHUMER	But that's not the point here.
0	198.0		SCHUMER	We have a disagreement about the wall —
0	199.0		TRUMP	Well, the Washington Post —
0	200.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	201.0		SCHUMER	— whether it's effective or it isn't.
0	202.0		SCHUMER	Not on border security, but on the wall.
0	203.0		SCHUMER	We do not want to shut down the government.
0	204.0		SCHUMER	You have called 20 times to shut down the government.
0	205.0		SCHUMER	"You say, ""I want to shut down the government."""
0	206.0		SCHUMER	We don't.
0	207.0		SCHUMER	We want to come to an agreement.
0	208.0		SCHUMER	If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government.
0	209.0		SCHUMER	And that's what we're urging you to do.
0	210.0		SCHUMER	Not threaten to shut down the government —
0	211.0		TRUMP	Chuck —
0	212.0		SCHUMER	— because you —
0	213.0		TRUMP	You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.
0	214.0		SCHUMER	Let me just finish.
0	215.0		SCHUMER	Because you can't get your way.
0	216.0		TRUMP	Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.
0	217.0		SCHUMER	Yeah.
0	218.0		SCHUMER	Let me say something, Mr. President.
0	219.0		SCHUMER	"You just say, ""My way, or we'll shut down the government."""
0	220.0		SCHUMER	We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.
0	221.0		SCHUMER	We urge you to take it.
0	222.0		TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.
0	223.0		PELOSI	It is good border security.
0	224.0		SCHUMER	It is very good border security.
0	225.0		TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.
0	226.0		PELOSI	It's actually what the border security asked for.
0	227.0		SCHUMER	It's what the border —
0	228.0		TRUMP	Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military —
0	229.0		SCHUMER	You just said it is effective.
0	230.0		TRUMP	Can I be — can I tell you something?
0	231.0		SCHUMER	Yeah, you just said it's effective.
0	232.0		TRUMP	Without a wall — these are only areas where you have the walls.
0	233.0		SCHUMER	We want to do this —
0	234.0		TRUMP	Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective.
0	235.0		TRUMP	Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.
0	236.0		PELOSI	Wait a second.
0	237.0		PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.
0	238.0		SCHUMER	Yeah.
0	239.0		PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.
0	240.0		PELOSI	We've come in here as the first branch of government: Article I, the legislative branch.
0	241.0		PELOSI	We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.
0	242.0		SCHUMER	Open.
0	243.0		TRUMP	We're going to keep it open —
0	244.0		PELOSI	The American —
0	245.0		TRUMP	— if we have border security.
0	246.0		PELOSI	The American —
0	247.0		TRUMP	If we don't have border security, Chuck —
0	248.0		PELOSI	I'm with you.
0	249.0		TRUMP	— we're not going to keep it open.
0	250.0		PELOSI	I'm with you.
0	251.0		PELOSI	We are going to have border security.
0	252.0		SCHUMER	And it's the same border –
0	253.0		PELOSI	Effective border security.
0	254.0		SCHUMER	You're bragging about what has been done.
0	255.0		TRUMP	By us.
0	256.0		SCHUMER	We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.
0	257.0		SCHUMER	That's our proposal.
0	258.0		SCHUMER	If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.
0	259.0		TRUMP	Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.
0	260.0		SCHUMER	Let's debate —
0	261.0		PELOSI	We have taken —
0	262.0		SCHUMER	Let's debate in private.
0	263.0		PELOSI	We have taken this conversation —
0	264.0		SCHUMER	Okay?
0	265.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	266.0		SCHUMER	Yeah.
0	267.0		PELOSI	— to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact.
0	268.0		PELOSI	And we can dispel that.
0	269.0		TRUMP	We need border security.
0	270.0		TRUMP	And I think we all agree that we need border security.
0	271.0		SCHUMER	Yes, we do.
0	272.0		TRUMP	Is that right?
0	273.0		SCHUMER	We do.
0	274.0		TRUMP	See?
0	275.0		TRUMP	We get along.
0	276.0		TRUMP	Thank you, everybody.
0	277.0		SYSTEM	(Inaudible)
0	278.0		QUESTION	Mr. President.
0	279.0		QUESTION	You say border security and the wall.
0	280.0		QUESTION	Can you have border security without the wall?
0	281.0		QUESTION	There's a commonality on border security.
0	282.0		TRUMP	No, you need the wall.
0	283.0		TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.
0	284.0		QUESTION	Are you re-defining what it means to have border security?
0	285.0		SCHUMER	Yes.
0	286.0		TRUMP	Yeah.
0	287.0		TRUMP	We need border security.
0	288.0		TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.
0	289.0		TRUMP	You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.
0	290.0		PELOSI	That's simply not true.
0	291.0		PELOSI	That is a political promise.
0	292.0		PELOSI	Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.
0	293.0		SCHUMER	And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.
0	294.0		TRUMP	It totally solves the problem.
0	295.0		PELOSI	Again, but I don't want to take this —
0	296.0		TRUMP	And it's very important.
0	297.0		PELOSI	"Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from — we came at a place to say, ""How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?"""
1	298.0		PELOSI	The economy has — people are losing their jobs.
0	299.0		PELOSI	The market is in a mood.
0	300.0		PELOSI	Our members are already (inaudible).
1	301.0		TRUMP	Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years.
0	302.0		PELOSI	Sixty people of the Republican Party have lost — are losing their offices now because of the transition.
0	303.0		PELOSI	People are not — the morale is not —
0	304.0		TRUMP	And we've gained in the Senate.
0	305.0		TRUMP	Nancy, we've gained in the Senate.
0	306.0		PELOSI	The morale —
0	307.0		TRUMP	Excuse me.
0	308.0		TRUMP	Did we win the Senate?
0	309.0		PELOSI	— is not (inaudible).
0	310.0		TRUMP	We won the Senate.
0	311.0		PELOSI	When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.
0	312.0		TRUMP	I did.
0	313.0		PELOSI	Let me say this.
0	314.0		TRUMP	We did win North Dakota.
0	315.0		PELOSI	This is the most unfortunate thing.
0	316.0		PELOSI	We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view.
0	317.0		TRUMP	But it's not bad, Nancy.
0	318.0		PELOSI	Let us — no, but it's —
0	319.0		TRUMP	It's called transparency.
0	320.0		PELOSI	I know.
0	321.0		PELOSI	But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.
0	322.0		PELOSI	And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  —
0	323.0		TRUMP	You know what?
0	324.0		TRUMP	We need border security.
0	325.0		PELOSI	"— without saying to the public, ""This isn't true."""
0	326.0		TRUMP	That's what we're going to be talking about: border security.
0	327.0		TRUMP	If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government.
0	328.0		TRUMP	This country needs border security.
0	329.0		PELOSI	We agree with that.
0	330.0		TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.
0	331.0		SYSYTEM	(Inaudible.)
0	332.0		TRUMP	Let's have a talk.
0	333.0		TRUMP	We're going to get the wall built and we've done a lot of wall already.
0	334.0		QUESTION	Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?
0	335.0		QUESTION	Is that the —
0	336.0		TRUMP	It's a big section.
0	337.0		TRUMP	It's a big part of it.
0	338.0		QUESTION	Is it everything that you need?
0	339.0		TRUMP	It's a big part of it.
0	340.0		TRUMP	We need to have effective border security.
0	341.0		TRUMP	We need a wall in certain parts — no, not in all parts — but in certain parts of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall.
0	342.0		QUESTION	How much money, Mr. President?
0	343.0		TRUMP	We are doing it much under budget.
0	344.0		TRUMP	We're actually way under —
0	345.0		QUESTION	(Inaudible) this conversation.
0	346.0		TRUMP	— budget on the areas that we've renovated and areas that we've built.
0	347.0		TRUMP	I would say if we got —
0	348.0		QUESTION	Do you still need the —
0	349.0		TRUMP	— if we got $5 billion, we could do a tremendous chunk of wall.
0	350.0		QUESTION	Is that mandatory?
0	351.0		QUESTION	Would you accept less though?
0	352.0		QUESTION	And are your guests conversely willing to offer more?
0	353.0		TRUMP	Well, we're going to see.
0	354.0		TRUMP	We're going to see.
0	355.0		TRUMP	Look, we have to have the wall.
0	356.0		TRUMP	This isn't a question; this is a national emergency.
0	357.0		TRUMP	Drugs are pouring into our country.
1	358.0		TRUMP	People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases, it's contagious.
0	359.0		TRUMP	They're pouring into our country.
0	360.0		TRUMP	We have to have border security.
0	361.0		TRUMP	We have to have a wall as part of border security.
0	362.0		TRUMP	And I don't think we really disagree so much.
0	363.0		TRUMP	I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that.
0	364.0		TRUMP	And I fully understand that.
0	365.0		TRUMP	We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.
0	366.0		PELOSI	Mr. President —
0	367.0		TRUMP	But we have to have border security.
0	368.0		PELOSI	Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the Leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory.
0	369.0		PELOSI	But let me —
0	370.0		SCHUMER	Elections have consequences, Mr. President.
0	371.0		PELOSI	Let me just say —
0	372.0		TRUMP	That's right.
0	373.0		TRUMP	And that's why the country is doing so well.
0	374.0		PELOSI	Let me say this:
0	375.0		PELOSI	What the President is representing in terms of his cards over there are not factual.
0	376.0		PELOSI	We have to have to an evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent, and how effective it is.
0	377.0		PELOSI	This isn't about — this is about the security of our country.
0	378.0		PELOSI	We take an oath to protect and defend, and we don't want to have that mischaracterized by anyone.
0	379.0		PELOSI	And we are —
0	380.0		TRUMP	I agree with that.
0	381.0		PELOSI	— that we are —
0	382.0		TRUMP	No, no I agree with that.
0	383.0		PELOSI	— we are (inaudible).
0	384.0		PELOSI	So let us have a conversation where we don't have to contradict, in public, the statistics that you put forth but instead can have a conversation about what would really work and what the American people deserve from us at this uncertain time in their lives, where they have apprehension.
0	385.0		SCHUMER	The one thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute.
0	386.0		SCHUMER	And you want to shut it down.
0	387.0		TRUMP	You keep talking about it.
0	388.0		TRUMP	I — no, no, no, no, no.
1	389.0		TRUMP	The last time, Chuck, you shut it down —
0	390.0		SCHUMER	No, no, no.
0	391.0		TRUMP	— and then you opened it up very quickly.
0	392.0		SCHUMER	Twenty times.
0	393.0		SCHUMER	Twenty times.
0	394.0		TRUMP	And I don't want to do what you did.
0	395.0		TRUMP	But, Chuck —
0	396.0		SCHUMER	"Twenty times you have called for, ""I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall."""
0	397.0		SCHUMER	None of us have said —
0	398.0		TRUMP	You want to know something?
0	399.0		SCHUMER	You've said it.
0	400.0		TRUMP	Okay, you want to put that on my —
0	401.0		SCHUMER	You said it.
0	402.0		TRUMP	I'll take it.
0	403.0		SCHUMER	Okay, good.
0	404.0		TRUMP	You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other — whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government.
0	405.0		TRUMP	Absolutely.
0	406.0		SCHUMER	Okay.
0	407.0		SCHUMER	Fair enough.
0	408.0		SCHUMER	We disagree.
0	409.0		TRUMP	And I am proud — and I'll tell you what —
0	410.0		SCHUMER	We disagree.
0	411.0		TRUMP	I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.
0	412.0		TRUMP	So I will take the mantle.
0	413.0		TRUMP	I will be the one to shut it down.
0	414.0		TRUMP	I'm not going to blame you for it.
0	415.0		TRUMP	The last time you shut it down, it didn't work.
0	416.0		TRUMP	I will take the mantle of shutting down.
0	417.0		PELOSI	That is (inaudible).
0	418.0		TRUMP	And I'm going to shut it down for border security.
0	419.0		SCHUMER	But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.
0	420.0		TRUMP	Okay.
0	421.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.
0	422.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	423.0		PELOSI	(Inaudible) shut down the government.
0	424.0		QUESTION	Chief of Staff?
0	425.0		QUESTION	Have you picked a Chief of Staff, Mr. President?
0	426.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	427.0		TRUMP	Yeah, we're interviewing a lot of — we have a lot of great people for Chief of Staff.
0	428.0		TRUMP	A lot of people want the job.
0	429.0		TRUMP	A lot of people want the job.
0	430.0		TRUMP	And I have some great people.
0	431.0		TRUMP	A lot of friends of mine want it.
0	432.0		TRUMP	A lot of people that Chuck and Nancy know very well want it.
0	433.0		TRUMP	I think people you'd like.
0	434.0		TRUMP	We have a lot of people that want the job — Chief of Staff.
0	435.0		TRUMP	So we'll be seeing what happens very soon.
0	436.0		TRUMP	We're in no rush.
0	437.0		TRUMP	We're in no rush.
0	438.0		QUESTION	Why?
0	439.0		QUESTION	Why no rush, Mr. President?
0	440.0		TRUMP	Why?
0	441.0		TRUMP	Because we have a wonderful Chief of Staff right now.
0	442.0		TRUMP	Just no — we are in no rush.
0	443.0		TRUMP	Over a period of a week or two, or maybe less, we'll announce who it's going to be.
0	444.0		TRUMP	But we have a lot of people that want the position.
0	445.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.
0	446.0		TRUMP	Thanks.
0	1.0		TRUMP	Thank you, Klaus, very much.
0	2.0		TRUMP	It’s a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy, and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security, and peace.
0	3.0		TRUMP	I’m here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm America’s friendship and partnership in building a better world.
0	4.0		TRUMP	Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear.
0	5.0		TRUMP	Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S.
0	6.0		TRUMP	We’re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream — the dream of a great job, a safe home, and a better life for their children.
0	7.0		TRUMP	After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth.
0	8.0		TRUMP	The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election.
1	9.0		TRUMP	Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades.
1	10.0		TRUMP	Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially.
0	11.0		TRUMP	Small-business optimism is at an all-time high.
1	12.0		TRUMP	New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century.
1	13.0		TRUMP	African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans.
0	14.0		TRUMP	The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.
0	15.0		TRUMP	I’m here to deliver a simple message:
0	16.0		TRUMP	There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States.
0	17.0		TRUMP	America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.
0	18.0		TRUMP	The American economy is by far the largest in the world, and we’ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history.
0	19.0		TRUMP	We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard-earned money.
0	20.0		TRUMP	We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent.
0	21.0		TRUMP	As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000.
1	22.0		TRUMP	The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000.
0	23.0		TRUMP	The world’s largest company, Apple, announced plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America.
0	24.0		TRUMP	Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years.
0	25.0		TRUMP	Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States.
1	26.0		TRUMP	This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived.
0	27.0		TRUMP	Regulation is stealth taxation.
0	28.0		TRUMP	The U.S., like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats — and we have — believe me, we have them all over the place — and they’ve imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability.
0	29.0		TRUMP	In America, those days are over.
0	30.0		TRUMP	I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation.
0	31.0		TRUMP	We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations.
0	32.0		TRUMP	Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every 1 new rule.
0	33.0		TRUMP	We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before.
0	34.0		TRUMP	We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production.
0	35.0		TRUMP	America is the place to do business.
0	36.0		TRUMP	So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build.
0	37.0		TRUMP	I believe in America.
0	38.0		TRUMP	As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also.
0	39.0		TRUMP	But America first does not mean America alone.
0	40.0		TRUMP	When the United States grows, so does the world.
0	41.0		TRUMP	American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives.
0	42.0		TRUMP	As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules.
0	43.0		TRUMP	We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.
0	44.0		TRUMP	We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.
0	45.0		TRUMP	Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all.
0	46.0		TRUMP	The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning.
0	47.0		TRUMP	These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe.
0	48.0		TRUMP	Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers.
0	49.0		TRUMP	We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system.
0	50.0		TRUMP	Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. but for all nations.
0	51.0		TRUMP	As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries.
0	52.0		TRUMP	This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important.
0	53.0		TRUMP	We have agreements with several of them already.
0	54.0		TRUMP	We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.
0	55.0		TRUMP	My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independence.
0	56.0		TRUMP	We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses, and to promote energy security for our friends all around the world.
0	57.0		TRUMP	No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy.
0	58.0		TRUMP	America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America.
0	59.0		TRUMP	We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.
0	60.0		TRUMP	We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.
0	61.0		TRUMP	We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable.
0	62.0		TRUMP	And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.
0	63.0		TRUMP	We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world.
0	64.0		TRUMP	Energy is abundant and affordable.
0	65.0		TRUMP	There has never been a better time to come to America.
0	66.0		TRUMP	We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security.
0	67.0		TRUMP	To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations.
0	68.0		TRUMP	Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.
0	69.0		TRUMP	My administration is proud to have led historic efforts, at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world, to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean Peninsula.
0	70.0		TRUMP	We continue to call on partners to confront Iran’s support for terrorists and block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.
0	71.0		TRUMP	We’re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so.
0	72.0		TRUMP	The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology.
1	73.0		TRUMP	I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.
0	74.0		TRUMP	There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains.
0	75.0		TRUMP	We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.
0	76.0		TRUMP	I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts.
0	77.0		TRUMP	You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people.
0	78.0		TRUMP	When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation.
0	79.0		TRUMP	We will defend our citizens and our borders.
0	80.0		TRUMP	We are also securing our immigration system, as a matter of both national and economic security.
0	81.0		TRUMP	America is a cutting-edge economy, but our immigration system is stuck in the past.
0	82.0		TRUMP	We must replace our current system of extended-family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country.
0	83.0		TRUMP	In rebuilding America, we are also fully committed to developing our workforce.
0	84.0		TRUMP	We are lifting people from dependence to independence, because we know the single best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck.
0	85.0		TRUMP	To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy.
0	86.0		TRUMP	We must invest in our people.
0	87.0		TRUMP	When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured.
0	88.0		TRUMP	Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all.
0	89.0		TRUMP	The nation’s greatness is more than the sum of its production.
0	90.0		TRUMP	A nation’s greatness is the sum of its citizens: the values, pride, love, devotion, and character of the people who call that nation home.
0	91.0		TRUMP	From my first international G7 Summit, to the G20, to the U.N. General Assembly, to APEC, to the World Trade Organization, and today at the World Economic Forum, my administration has not only been present, but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate toward shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams.
0	92.0		TRUMP	Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the world.
0	93.0		TRUMP	You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants, and many of the brightest minds in many fields.
0	94.0		TRUMP	Each of you has the power to change hearts, transform lives, and shape your countries’ destinies.
0	95.0		TRUMP	With this power comes an obligation, however — a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, and customers who have made you who you are.
0	96.0		TRUMP	So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people — to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams; to protect their families, their communities, their histories, and their futures.
0	97.0		TRUMP	That’s what we’re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable.
0	98.0		TRUMP	It’s why new businesses and investment are flooding in.
0	99.0		TRUMP	It’s why our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in so many decades.
0	100.0		TRUMP	It’s why America’s future has never been brighter.
0	101.0		TRUMP	Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together.
0	102.0		TRUMP	Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience.
0	103.0		TRUMP	But most importantly, thank you to all of the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone.
0	104.0		TRUMP	Together, let us send our love and our gratitude to make them, because they really make our countries run.
0	105.0		TRUMP	They make our countries great.
0	106.0		TRUMP	Thank you, and God bless you all.
0	107.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	108.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	109.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0	110.0		MR. SCHWAB	Thank you, Mr. President, for this inspiring speech.
0	111.0		MR. SCHWAB	As it is tradition at the forum, I will ask you one or two questions.
0	112.0		MR. SCHWAB	And my first question is, why is the tax reform — why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?
0	113.0		TRUMP	Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you.
0	114.0		TRUMP	This is an incredible group of people.
0	115.0		TRUMP	We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years.
0	116.0		TRUMP	And it was truly an incredible group.
0	117.0		TRUMP	But I think I have 15 new friends.
0	118.0		TRUMP	So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum.
0	119.0		TRUMP	The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done.
0	120.0		TRUMP	Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform.
0	121.0		TRUMP	And ours is cutting and reforming.
0	122.0		TRUMP	We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.
0	123.0		TRUMP	We’ve wanted to do it.
0	124.0		TRUMP	It is very tough, politically, to do it.
0	125.0		TRUMP	Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.
0	126.0		TRUMP	That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.
0	127.0		TRUMP	And once we got it going, it was going.
0	128.0		TRUMP	And the big — and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies.
0	129.0		TRUMP	And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.
0	130.0		TRUMP	And even today they just announced many more.
0	131.0		TRUMP	But every day they announce more and more.
0	132.0		TRUMP	And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most.
0	133.0		TRUMP	It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000.
0	134.0		TRUMP	This is something that we didn’t anticipate.
0	135.0		TRUMP	Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate.
0	136.0		TRUMP	Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing.
0	137.0		TRUMP	This came out of nowhere.
0	138.0		TRUMP	Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.
0	139.0		TRUMP	It wasn’t in the equation.
0	140.0		TRUMP	We waited — we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in.
0	141.0		TRUMP	And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck — because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing.
0	142.0		TRUMP	And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be — well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in.
0	143.0		TRUMP	And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.
0	144.0		TRUMP	We’ve set 84 records since my election — record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period.
0	145.0		TRUMP	And that’s a great thing.
0	146.0		TRUMP	And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform.
0	147.0		TRUMP	So what happened is really something special.
0	148.0		TRUMP	Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion.
0	149.0		TRUMP	And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S.
0	150.0		TRUMP	And I will tell you, this moved up very substantially.
0	151.0		TRUMP	But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking — I thought they were talking $350 million.
0	152.0		TRUMP	And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant.
0	153.0		TRUMP	Not the greatest, but not bad.
0	154.0		TRUMP	And they said, “No, sir. It’s $350 billion.”
0	155.0		TRUMP	I said, that is something.
0	156.0		TRUMP	Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night — great companies.
0	157.0		TRUMP	They’re all investing.
0	158.0		TRUMP	When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” — because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars.
0	159.0		TRUMP	So I think you have a brand-new United States.
0	160.0		TRUMP	You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening.
0	161.0		TRUMP	And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them.
0	162.0		TRUMP	But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.
0	163.0		TRUMP	And we’re really doing — we had a great first year — so successful in so many different ways.
0	164.0		TRUMP	And there’s a tremendous spirit.
1	165.0		TRUMP	When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.
1	166.0		TRUMP	Same with Hispanic.
1	167.0		TRUMP	Women at a 17-year low.
0	168.0		TRUMP	It’s very heartwarming to see.
0	169.0		TRUMP	But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States.
0	170.0		TRUMP	I would say it’s a spirit like I have never witnessed before.
0	171.0		TRUMP	I’ve been here for awhile.
0	172.0		TRUMP	I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now.
0	173.0		TRUMP	So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much.
0	174.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	175.0		MR. SCHWAB	Mr. President, I will ask you, maybe, a personal question.
0	176.0		MR. SCHWAB	But before doing so, I’d just like to —
0	177.0		TRUMP	Sounds very interesting.
0	178.0		TRUMP	I didn’t know about this one.
0	179.0		MR. SCHWAB	I would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your Cabinet members
0	180.0		TRUMP	Yes.
0	181.0		MR. SCHWAB	— who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).
0	182.0		TRUMP	Good, I would like to do that.
0	183.0		TRUMP	That’s very nice.
0	184.0		MR. SCHWAB	Yeah.
0	185.0		MR. SCHWAB	Now —
0	186.0		TRUMP	Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know.
0	187.0		TRUMP	We’re making our military protection a little bit better for us too.
0	188.0		TRUMP	So thank you very much.
0	189.0		TRUMP	Does everybody understand that?
0	190.0		TRUMP	I think so.
0	191.0		TRUMP	Thank you all for being here.
0	192.0		MR. SCHWAB	Now my, maybe personal, question would be: What experience from your past have been most useful in preparing you for the Presidency?
0	193.0		TRUMP	Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me.
0	194.0		TRUMP	I’ve loved it.
0	195.0		TRUMP	I’ve always loved business.
0	196.0		TRUMP	I’ve always been good at building things, and I’ve always been successful at making money.
0	197.0		TRUMP	I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful.
0	198.0		TRUMP	And I’ve been good at it.
0	199.0		TRUMP	And that takes a certain ability.
0	200.0		TRUMP	And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.
0	201.0		TRUMP	It’s always been a general or a politician.
0	202.0		TRUMP	Throughout history, it’s always been a general — you had to be a general — but mostly it was politicians.
0	203.0		TRUMP	You never have a businessman.
1	204.0		TRUMP	And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.
0	205.0		TRUMP	That’s where we were heading.
0	206.0		TRUMP	I really believe that — because they were going to put on massive new regulations.
0	207.0		TRUMP	You couldn’t breathe.
0	208.0		TRUMP	It was choking our country to death.
0	209.0		TRUMP	And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson.
0	210.0		TRUMP	The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.
0	211.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	212.0		TRUMP	Throughout my whole life — somebody will explain someday why — but I’ve always gotten a lot.
0	213.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	214.0		TRUMP	And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press.
0	215.0		TRUMP	The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press.
0	216.0		TRUMP	And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be.
0	217.0		TRUMP	As the cameras start going off in the background.
0	218.0		SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0	219.0		TRUMP	But overall — I mean, the bottom line — somebody said, well, they couldn’t have been that bad because here we are — we’re President.
0	220.0		TRUMP	And I think we’re doing a really great job with my team.
0	221.0		TRUMP	I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think we’re doing a very special job.
0	222.0		TRUMP	And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people.
0	223.0		TRUMP	We have a very pro-business group.
0	224.0		TRUMP	We have regulations cut to a level — in the history of our country, Klaus — this was reported recently.
0	225.0		TRUMP	In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case.
0	226.0		TRUMP	We’ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go.
0	227.0		TRUMP	I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done.
0	228.0		TRUMP	And we’re going to have regulation.
0	229.0		TRUMP	There’s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them.
0	230.0		TRUMP	But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go.
0	231.0		TRUMP	So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something.
0	232.0		TRUMP	And one other thing I said — and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople — I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work.
0	233.0		TRUMP	And the reason I’m a cheerleader is because it’s easy — because I love our country and I think we’re just doing really well.
0	234.0		TRUMP	And we look forward to seeing you in America — special place — and where you are is a special place also.
0	235.0		TRUMP	Thank you all very much.
0	236.0		TRUMP	I appreciate it.
0	237.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	238.0		MR. SCHWAB	Thank you.
0	239.0		MR. SCHWAB	Thank you very much, Mr. President, for being with us.
0	240.0		MR. SCHWAB	The World Economic Forum community, who is assembled here, will be certainly — and I quote you from the last piece of your remarks — will be certainly among “the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day making this world a better place for everyone.”
0	241.0		MR. SCHWAB	Thank you very much for being with us.
0	242.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	243.0		TRUMP	Thank you very much everybody.
0	244.0		TRUMP	Thank you.
0	245.0		SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0	1.0		TRUMP	My fellow Americans:
1	2.0		TRUMP	Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.
0	3.0		TRUMP	Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.
0	4.0		TRUMP	We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.
0	5.0		TRUMP	America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.
1	6.0		TRUMP	But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.
1	7.0		TRUMP	It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.
0	8.0		TRUMP	Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
1	9.0		TRUMP	Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
0	10.0		TRUMP	Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border.
0	11.0		TRUMP	More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
1	12.0		TRUMP	In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.
1	13.0		TRUMP	Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.
0	14.0		TRUMP	This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
0	15.0		TRUMP	Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase.
0	16.0		TRUMP	These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
0	17.0		TRUMP	One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.
0	18.0		TRUMP	Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.
0	19.0		TRUMP	This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
0	20.0		TRUMP	This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.
0	21.0		TRUMP	My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.
0	22.0		TRUMP	It’s a tremendous problem.
0	23.0		TRUMP	Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.
0	24.0		TRUMP	These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.
0	25.0		TRUMP	In fact, safer than ever before.
0	26.0		TRUMP	The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.
0	27.0		TRUMP	We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.
0	28.0		TRUMP	Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.
0	29.0		TRUMP	Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.
1	30.0		TRUMP	Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.
1	31.0		TRUMP	At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.
0	32.0		TRUMP	This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.
0	33.0		TRUMP	It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.
0	34.0		TRUMP	This is just common sense.
0	35.0		TRUMP	The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.

0	42.0		TRUMP	The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.
0	43.0		TRUMP	My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.
0	44.0		TRUMP	But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.
0	45.0		TRUMP	This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.
0	46.0		TRUMP	I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.
0	47.0		TRUMP	Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.
0	48.0		TRUMP	Some have suggested a barrier is immoral.
0	49.0		TRUMP	Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?
0	50.0		TRUMP	They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.
0	51.0		TRUMP	The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.

0	62.0		TRUMP	I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.
0	63.0		TRUMP	How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?
0	64.0		TRUMP	To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?
0	65.0		TRUMP	To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.
0	66.0		TRUMP	To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.
